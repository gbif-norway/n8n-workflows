**Human:** - **General Environment:** Terrestrial  
- **Substrate Type:** Mix of mineral soil and fine organic material (visible leaf litter and degraded plant matter)  
- **Moisture/Water Presence:** Moist ground (indicated by presence of healthy herbaceous vegetation and some green moss-like patches)  
- **Vegetation Structure:** Dense low vegetation (mixture of herbs, grasses, and some dwarf shrubs)  
- **Dominant Plant Growth Forms:** Herbs/Forbs (~50%), Grasses (~30%), Mosses (~10%), Dwarf shrubs (~10%)  
- **Identifiable Plant Species:** Likely Viola species (violet flowers in central foreground, possibly Viola canina or Viola riviniana)  
- **Surface Features/Topography:** Flat to gently sloping terrain (no significant topographical variation visible in image)  
- **Exposure:** Appears moderately exposed (no visible canopy cover or protective features)  
- **Signs of Natural Disturbance:** Not clearly visible  
- **Signs of Human Influence/Management:** Not clearly visible  
- **Other Notable Features:** Presence of dry fallen leaves suggests seasonal deciduous plant influence in the area.

**AI:** Based on your description of a terrestrial site with a mix of mineral soil and organic material, moist ground, dense low vegetation dominated by herbs and grasses, and moderate exposure, the most likely major type group is Fastmarkssystemer.

Does [{NA-T}](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T) (Fastmarkssystemer) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does {NA-T} (Fastmarkssystemer) fit your site? 
Answer: yes

**AI:** Okay, acknowledging NA-T Fastmarkssystemer.

Based on your description of dense low vegetation with herbs and grasses dominating on moist ground and lacking canopy cover, the most likely major type is Semi-natural meadow.

Does [{NA-TK01}](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01) (Semi-naturlig eng) fit your site? It typically describes open land maintained by historical use like mowing or grazing. (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does {NA-TK01} (Semi-naturlig eng), which describes open land maintained by historical use like mowing or grazing, fit your site? 
Answer: yes

**AI:** Okay, thank you for confirming.

Your description of moist ground, dense low vegetation with herbs and grasses, no canopy cover, and likely presence of Viola species aligns well with an open, slightly lime-rich semi-natural meadow.

The tool could be more useful if it could directly access the structure of the type hierarchy (Hovedtypegruppe, Hovedtype, Kartleggingsenheter/Grunntype) for a given Hovedtypegruppe or Hovedtype code, including the names and codes at each level. This would allow for more direct navigation and selection within the hierarchy without relying solely on free-text search for every step.
