**Human:** - **General Environment:** Terrestrial  
- **Substrate Type:** Mineral soil with a grass-covered surface; underlying particle size not clearly visible  
- **Moisture/Water Presence:** Moist ground (visual cues from green grass and absence of waterlogging suggest adequate moisture)  
- **Vegetation Structure:** Dense low vegetation (grassland)  
- **Dominant Plant Growth Forms:** Grasses (~80%), Herbs/Forbs (~15%), Sparse presence of Dwarf shrubs or other growth forms (~5%)  
- **Identifiable Plant Species:** Possible *Viola* species (indicative purple flower consistent with members of the violet genus)  
- **Surface Features/Topography:** Flat to gently sloping terrain; no large surface features like boulders or patterned ground visible  
- **Exposure:** Appears semi-sheltered (presence of background trees and absence of heavy weathering or wind-related vegetation deformation)  
- **Signs of Natural Disturbance:** Not clearly visible  
- **Signs of Human Influence/Management:** Possible mowing or grazing (evenness and height of grass suggest management)  
- **Other Notable Features:** None clearly visible beyond typical early-season grassland flora.

**AI:** Based on your description of a terrestrial area with mineral soil, grass cover, and potential management like mowing or grazing, the most likely major type group is Fastmarkssystemer.

Does [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA) fit your site? It includes terrestrial ecosystems on mineral soil or solid rock. (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer) fit your site, given it includes terrestrial ecosystems on mineral soil or solid rock? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Okay, the site is within the [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA) major type group.

Your description mentions dense low vegetation dominated by grasses with some herbs, and possible signs of management like mowing or grazing. This points towards a grassland maintained by traditional methods.

Based on the grassland vegetation and possible signs of management like mowing or grazing, does [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA-TK) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng) fit your site? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Okay, the site is classified as [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA-TK).

Your description suggests the site is open (no tree layer) and potentially managed by mowing or grazing. This helps narrow down the type.

To distinguish between the specific types of semi-natural meadows, we need to know about the calcium content of the soil. Plants can be good indicators.

Explain: "The presence of certain plants can tell us if the soil is rich or poor in calcium."
Question: "Do you observe any plants that are typical indicators of calcium-rich soil, such as Kidney Vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), Mountain Avens (Dryas octopetala), or various Orchid species? (yes/no)"
