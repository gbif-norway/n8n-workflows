**Human:** - **General Environment:** Terrestrial  
- **Substrate Type:** Mineral soil with a thin organic layer (grassy cover)  
- **Moisture/Water Presence:** Moist ground (appears neither dry nor saturated; moderately green vegetation suggests adequate soil moisture)  
- **Vegetation Structure:** Dense low vegetation (grass-dominated ground layer) with scattered trees in the background  
- **Dominant Plant Growth Forms:** Grasses (~70%), Herbs/Forbs (~15%), Dwarf shrubs (~5%), Trees (~10%)  
- **Identifiable Plant Species:** Possible Viola species (violet flowers in foreground)  
- **Surface Features/Topography:** Gently sloping terrain; mostly flat in the foreground  
- **Exposure:** Appears moderately sheltered (presence of trees and no clear signs of high wind or water exposure)  
- **Signs of Natural Disturbance:** Not clearly visible  
- **Signs of Human Influence/Management:** Not clearly visible (no visible signs of mowing, grazing, or paths, though the uniform grassy cover could suggest some management)  
- **Other Notable Features:** None clearly visible

**AI:** Based on your description of a terrestrial site with mineral soil and vegetation, the most likely major type group is [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T). These are systems on mineral or exposed bedrock that are not permanently covered by water or ice.

Does this fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does the described major type group NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer) fit your site? 
Answer: yes

**AI:** Based on your description of dense grass and herb cover with scattered trees, [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01) seems like a strong candidate. This type includes grasslands and meadows maintained by traditional methods like mowing or grazing.

Does [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng) fit your site? 
Answer: yes

**AI:** To determine the specific mapping unit within [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01), we need to consider the calcium level of the soil.

Can you tell me if the soil is calcium-rich, moderately rich, or calcium-poor? (calcium-rich/moderately rich/calcium-poor)
