**Human:** Question: Does NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer) fit your site based on the description provided? 
Answer: yes

**Human:** - **General Environment:** Terrestrial  
- **Substrate Type:** Mineral soil (not directly visible but inferred from grass cover and tree presence); some small patches of bare soil at the base of trees/shrubs  
- **Moisture/Water Presence:** Moist ground (suggested by lush grass growth and overall green vegetation)  
- **Vegetation Structure:** Forest with ground vegetation; scattered deciduous trees with a continuous herbaceous ground layer  
- **Dominant Plant Growth Forms:**  
  - Grasses (~70%)  
  - Trees (~20%)  
  - Shrubs (~10%)  
- **Identifiable Plant Species:**  
  - Not clearly identifiable from image; probable fruit trees (possibly Malus or Prunus spp.) based on growth form and bark, but cannot confirm species  
- **Surface Features/Topography:** Gently sloping terrain with no visible large rocks or boulders; some tree bases slightly elevated  
- **Exposure:** Appears moderately sheltered (presence of trees suggests some wind protection; no clear signs of wind damage or open exposure)  
- **Signs of Natural Disturbance:** None visibly evident  
- **Signs of Human Influence/Management:**  
  - Regular mowing or maintenance implied by even grass height  
  - Possible planted trees and shrubs  
- **Other Notable Features:** None discernible beyond maintained appearance indicative of a semi-natural or managed site  

This site appears to be a semi-natural or anthropogenically influenced area such as an orchard or garden-like setting.

**AI:** Based on your description of a terrestrial site with mineral soil, forest elements, a dominant grass layer, and signs of regular mowing and potential planting, the most likely major type group is NA-T.

[NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA-T) covers terrestrial ecosystems where the ground is not permanently saturated with water.

Does [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA-T) fit your site? (yes/no)

**AI:** Based on your description of a managed, grassy terrestrial area with scattered trees and shrubs, likely maintained by mowing, the next likely level is a major type within NA-T.

[NA-TN03 (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TN03) describes managed grassy areas like parks and gardens that don't have a semi-natural management pattern. This fits sites with sown grass and intensive maintenance.

Does [NA-TN03 (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TN03) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TN03 (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg) fit your site? 
Answer: yes

**AI:** Great, the description of a managed, grassy area with scattered trees and shrubs, likely maintained by regular mowing, strongly points to this category.

Within [NA-TN03 (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TN03), there is one main mapping unit: [TN03-M005-01 (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TN03-M005-01). This unit covers areas like lawns, parks, and roadsides that are regularly maintained (like mowing) and don't show signs of traditional, semi-natural management practices (like grazing or haymaking). Your description of even grass height and potential planting fits this well.

Approve [TN03-M005-01 (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TN03-M005-01) as the basic type? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Approve TN03-M005-01 (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg) as the basic type? 
Answer: yes

**AI:** Great. Your description of a site with dominant grass cover, scattered trees, and clear signs of regular maintenance like mowing aligns well with the characteristics of managed grassy areas without traditional semi-natural management.

Confirmed type: [TN03-M005-01](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TN03-M005-01) (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg)
Confidence: High

To make the tools more useful, access to visual examples or characteristic species lists for each mapping unit would significantly enhance the identification process.
