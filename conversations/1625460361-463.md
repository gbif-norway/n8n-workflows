**AI:** Thank you for the detailed description of your site. Based on the information you provided about the terrestrial environment, mineral soil, and dry to slightly moist conditions with dense low vegetation, the most likely main type group is [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T).

Does [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer) fit your site? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Okay, great. Within [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T), your description of dense low vegetation dominated by herbs and grasses on mineral soil, along with dry to slightly moist conditions, points towards a meadow-like habitat.

The most probable Hovedtype fitting this description is [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01), which represents meadows maintained by historical human activities like mowing or grazing.

Does [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01) fit the general character of your site, keeping in mind that 'semi-natural' refers to the *historical* influence on the vegetation composition, even if current management isn't visible? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng) fit the general character of your site, keeping in mind that 'semi-natural' refers to the historical influence on the vegetation composition, even if current management isn't visible? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Okay, thank you. Within [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01), the soil's lime content is a key factor in determining the specific type.

The lime content of the soil strongly influences the types of plants that thrive. Calcium-rich soils support different species than calcium-poor soils.

Can you find plants that prefer calcium-rich ground, such as rock-rose (Helianthemum spp.), thyme (Thymus spp.), or various orchid species? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Can you find plants that prefer calcium-rich ground, such as rock-rose (Helianthemum spp.), thyme (Thymus spp.), or various orchid species? 
Answer: no

**AI:** Okay, thank you. That helps narrow down the possibilities for soil calcium levels.

Semi-natural meadows like [NA-TK01](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01) can range from dry to moist, and this affects the types of plants that grow there.

Does the ground feel consistently dry and well-drained, or is it sometimes squishy or noticeably damp underfoot, especially after rain? (consistently dry/sometimes damp)

**Human:** Question: For semi-natural meadows like NA-TK01, which can range from dry to moist and affects plant types, does the ground feel consistently dry and well-drained, or is it sometimes squishy or noticeably damp underfoot, especially after rain? 
Answer: consistently dry

**AI:** Based on your feedback that the ground is consistently dry and you did not find plants indicating calcium-rich conditions, your site appears to be a dry meadow without plants that need high calcium levels and no signs of recent clearing or an open tree layer.

The most likely type is [TK01-M005-16 (Kalkfattig åpen semi-naturlig ikke markryddet tørreng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TK01-M005-16), which describes a calcareous-poor, open, semi-natural dry meadow that hasn't been recently cleared.

Does this fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Based on the feedback, your site appears to be a dry meadow without plants that need high calcium levels and no signs of recent clearing or an open tree layer, most likely corresponding to TK01-M005-16 (Kalkfattig åpen semi-naturlig ikke markryddet tørreng). Does this description fit your site? 
Answer: Yes, it fits

**AI:** Key indicators—consistently dry ground, absence of calcium-indicator plants, and the characteristics of an open semi-natural meadow without signs of recent clearing—support this classification.

Confirmed type: [TK01-M005-16 (Kalkfattig åpen semi-naturlig ikke markryddet tørreng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TK01-M005-16)
Confidence: High

My tool could be more useful if I had the ability to interpret species lists or abundance data provided by the user to directly assess ecological conditions like calcium levels or moisture preferences.
