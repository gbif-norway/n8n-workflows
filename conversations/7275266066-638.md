**AI:** Based on your description of a terrestrial site with mineral soil and vegetation, the most likely major type group is [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NINPS13/NA-T).

Does this fit your site? It generally covers solid ground areas. (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer) fit your site, based on its description as a terrestrial site with mineral soil and vegetation generally covering solid ground areas? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Okay, great. Within [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NINPS13/NA-T), your description of dense, low, grass-dominated vegetation with scattered flowering plants and potential mowing points towards managed grassland types.

[NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NINPS13/NA-TK01) covers meadows shaped by traditional management like mowing or grazing, while [NA-TN02 (Blomsterenger, usprøytete vegkanter og liknende med semi-naturlig hevdpreg)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NINPS13/NA-TN02) is for managed areas like parks, roadsides, or flowerbeds with a semi-natural character.

Is this site primarily a managed area such as a garden, park, or roadside, rather than a more extensive meadow? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Is this site primarily a managed area such as a garden, park, or roadside, rather than a more extensive meadow? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Okay, thank you. Given that it's a managed area like a garden, park, or roadside with low, dense, grass-dominated vegetation that appears mowed, the most fitting major type within Fastmarkssystemer is likely [NA-TN02 (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NINPS13/NA-TN02).

This type describes areas like lawns and parks that are regularly maintained without necessarily having a traditional semi-natural meadow character.

Does this sound like the correct major type for your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Given that it's a managed area like a garden, park, or roadside with low, dense, grass-dominated vegetation that appears mowed, the most fitting major type within Fastmarkssystemer is likely NA-TN02 (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturnaturlig hevdpreg). This type describes areas like lawns and parks that are regularly maintained without necessarily having a traditional semi-natural meadow character. Does this sound like the correct major type for your site? 
Answer: yes

**AI:** Thank you for confirming [NA-TN02 (Blomsterenger, usprøytete vegkanter og liknende med semi-naturnaturlig hevdpreg)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NINPS13/NA-TN02).

Looking closer at the description, you mentioned "uniform grass height and absence of taller vegetation" and "potential mowing or maintenance," which strongly suggests regular and perhaps intensive management, like a typical lawn or park. [NA-TN02](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NINPS13/NA-TN02) generally refers to areas with a more semi-natural character, often less intensively managed, like flower meadows or unsprayed roadsides.

A major type that specifically covers regularly maintained areas like lawns and parks *without* a pronounced semi-natural character is [NA-TN03 (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NINPS13/NA-TN03).

Does [NA-TN03 (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NINPS13/NA-TN03) better match your site, given its appearance as a regularly mowed lawn or park area? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Based on the description of regular mowing and lawn/park appearance, does NA-TN03 (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg) better match your site than NA-TN02 (Blomsterenger, usprøytete vegkanter og liknende med semi-naturnaturlig hevdpreg)? 
Answer: Yes, NA-TN03 is a better match

**AI:** Okay, based on your confirmation that the site is a managed area like a lawn or park with regular mowing, [NA-TN03 (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NINPS13/NA-TN03) is indeed the correct major type.

Within this major type, there is one mapping unit that matches your description: [TN03-M005-01 (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NINPS13/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TN03-M005-01). This unit precisely covers sites like regularly mowed lawns, parks, and similar managed areas lacking a strong semi-natural character.

Confirmed type: [TN03-M005-01](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NINPS13/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TN03-M005-01) (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg)
