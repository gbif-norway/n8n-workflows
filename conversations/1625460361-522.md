**AI:** Based on your description of a terrestrial environment with mineral soil, dense low grass-dominated vegetation, and a nearby forest edge, the most likely Hovedtypegruppe is [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T). This group includes various dryland ecosystems like forests, grasslands, and open ground.

Does [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Based on your description of a terrestrial environment with mineral soil, dense low grass-dominated vegetation, and a nearby forest edge, does NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer) fit your site? 
Answer: yes

**AI:** Okay, great. [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T) covers terrestrial systems like forests, grasslands, and open ground, which aligns with your description.

Based on the grass-dominated vegetation and potential past management, a likely Hovedtype within this group is Semi-natural meadow.

Does [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01) fit your site? These are grasslands maintained by traditional management like mowing or grazing. (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng) fit your site? 
Answer: Yes, it fits.

**AI:** Okay, the site fits within [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01), which includes grasslands managed by traditional methods.

Based on your description of the ground being dry to slightly moist and having no overstory trees within the area, let's look closer at the moisture levels for open semi-natural meadows.

Does the ground feel consistently moist, or does it tend to dry out noticeably between rainfalls? (consistently moist / dries out)

**Human:** Question: Based on the description of the ground being dry to slightly moist, does the ground feel consistently moist or does it tend to dry out noticeably between rainfalls? 
Answer: Tends to dry out noticeably between rainfalls

**AI:** Okay, the ground tending to dry out between rainfalls points towards a 'tørreng' (dry meadow) within [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01).

The next important factor for classifying these meadows is the lime content of the soil. Different plant species thrive in different lime conditions.

Are there species like *Thymus serpyllum* (Wild Thyme), *Anthyllis vulneraria* (Kidney Vetch), or *Helianthemum nummularium* (Common Rock-rose) present? These species often indicate lime-rich conditions. (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Are species such as Thymus serpyllum, Anthyllis vulneraria, or Helianthemum nummularium, which indicate lime-rich conditions, present? 
Answer: No

**AI:** Okay, the absence of species like Wild Thyme and Kidney Vetch suggests the soil is likely not strongly lime-rich, directing us towards kalkfattig (lime-poor) or svakt kalkrik (slightly lime-rich) dry meadows.

We can look for other common plants to help determine the lime level more precisely. Lady's Bedstraw is often found in slightly richer dry grasslands.

Is *Galium verum* (Lady's Bedstraw) present in your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Is Galium verum (Lady's Bedstraw) present in your site? 
Answer: No

**AI:** Okay, the absence of lime indicators like Wild Thyme, Kidney Vetch, Common Rock-rose, and Lady's Bedstraw suggests the site is either lime-poor or only slightly lime-rich.

Let's refine this further. Lime-poor dry meadows often have species like *Nardus stricta* (Mat-grass) or heather (*Calluna vulgaris*, *Erica tetralix*). Slightly lime-rich dry meadows might have a broader mix of grasses and herbs, but still lack strong lime indicators.

Given the grass dominance you described, let's see if Mat-grass is a significant component.

Is *Nardus stricta* (Mat-grass) a common grass at your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Is Nardus stricta (Mat-grass) a common grass at your site? 
Answer: I don't know.

**AI:** Okay, identifying specific grasses can be tricky. Let's try a different approach to distinguish between lime-poor and slightly lime-rich dry meadows ([NA-TK01](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01)).

Lime-poor dry meadows ([TK01-M005-16](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TK01-M005-16)) often have a ground layer dominated by mosses and lichens, and the vegetation can appear less lush. Slightly lime-rich dry meadows ([TK01-M005-17](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TK01-M005-17)) tend to have a more diverse mix of grasses and herbs, and the vegetation might be taller or denser.

Based on your description of "Dense low vegetation, grass-dominated" and "Herbs/Forbs (~15%)", does the ground layer seem to be dominated by mosses and lichens, or is it mostly covered by grasses and herbs? (mosses/lichens dominant / grasses/herbs dominant)

**Human:** Question: Based on your description ('Dense low vegetation, grass-dominated', 'Herbs/Forbs (~15%)') and the context of distinguishing between lime-poor TK01-M005-16 and slightly lime-rich TK01-M005-17 dry meadows (NA-TK01), does the ground layer seem to be dominated by mosses and lichens or is it mostly covered by grasses and herbs? 
Answer: mostly covered by grasses and herbs

**AI:** Thanks for the additional information. The dominance of grasses and herbs over mosses and lichens, combined with the tendency for the ground to dry out and the absence of strong lime-loving indicator species, points towards a slightly lime-rich dry meadow.

Based on the evidence:
- Your site is a terrestrial system ([NA-T](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T)).
- It is a grass-dominated area possibly maintained by past management ([NA-TK01](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01) Semi-natural meadow).
- The ground dries out, indicating a dry meadow (Tørreng).
- The ground layer is dominated by grasses and herbs, not mosses and lichens, and lacks strong calciphiles, suggesting it is not strongly lime-poor or strongly lime-rich.

This information strongly supports the classification as a slightly lime-rich open semi-natural dry meadow.

Confirmed type: [TK01-M005-17](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TK01-M005-17) (Svakt kalkrik åpen semi-naturlig ikke markryddet tørreng)
