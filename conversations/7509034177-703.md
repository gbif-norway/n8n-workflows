**Human:** - **General Environment:** Terrestrial  
- **Substrate Type:** Bedrock outcrops with partial coverage of mosses and organic soil; scattered rocks/boulders visible  
- **Moisture/Water Presence:** Dry to moderately moist ground; no standing or running water observed  
- **Vegetation Structure:** Forest with moderately spaced trees allowing light penetration; understorey present but not dense  
- **Dominant Plant Growth Forms:** Trees (deciduous and coniferous, ~60%), Mosses (~20%), Shrubs and dwarf shrubs (~15%), Herbs/Forbs (~5%)  
- **Identifiable Plant Species:** Not clearly identifiable to species level from image; general forms suggest possible presence of birch and pine  
- **Surface Features/Topography:** Sloping terrain with bedrock exposures and moderate incline; uneven surface with rocky features  
- **Exposure:** Appears moderately exposed; visible sunlight and absence of dense canopy suggests partial exposure to wind and light  
- **Signs of Natural Disturbance:** No clear signs of recent natural disturbances visible  
- **Signs of Human Influence/Management:** No evident human structures, tracks, or clear signs of management or alteration  
- **Other Notable Features:** Moss-covered rocks and shaded microhabitats likely present due to forest cover and substrate diversity

**AI:** Based on your description of a terrestrial environment with bedrock, mosses, and forest, the most likely major type group is [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA-T).

Does [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA-T) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer) fit your site? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Great. Based on your description of a forested area on dry ground, the most likely major type is [NA-TB01 (Fastmarksskogsmark)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA-TB01).

Does [NA-TB01 (Fastmarksskogsmark)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA-TB01) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TB01 (Fastmarksskogsmark) fit your site? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Okay, you've identified the site as [NA-TB01 (Fastmarksskogsmark)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA-TB01). Now let's narrow down the specific type.

Given the presence of shrubs and dwarf shrubs in a forested area with dry to moderately moist conditions, a likely candidate is [TB01-M005-04 (Bærlyngskog)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TB01-M005-04). This type is characterized by berry-producing dwarf shrubs like lingonberry and crowberry.

Does [TB01-M005-04 (Bærlyngskog)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TB01-M005-04) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does TB01-M005-04 (Bærlyngskog) fit your site? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Confirmed type: [TB01-M005-04](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TB01-M005-04) (Bærlyngskog)
Confidence: High

To make this tool more useful, it could benefit from richer documentation access, including characteristic species lists for each mapping unit and specific environmental parameters (like soil pH ranges, typical moisture gradients, or exposure levels) linked directly to the codes. This would allow for more targeted questions to differentiate between similar types based on field-observable characteristics.
