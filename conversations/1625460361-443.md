**Human:** - **General Environment:** Terrestrial  
- **Substrate Type:** Predominantly mineral soil; presence of scattered stones and boulders  
- **Moisture/Water Presence:** Dry to slightly moist ground; no visible water bodies or signs of waterlogging  
- **Vegetation Structure:** Mostly open grassland with surrounding forest edge; forest contains both coniferous and deciduous elements  
- **Dominant Plant Growth Forms:** Grasses (~70%), Trees (~20%), Shrubs and Dwarf shrubs (~10%)  
- **Identifiable Plant Species:** One identifiable conifer (likely a spruce or pine); presence of deciduous trees (likely birch species); specific species identification not clearly determinable  
- **Surface Features/Topography:** Gently sloping terrain; scattered surface stones and medium boulders; nearby hillside in the background  
- **Exposure:** Appears moderately exposed; some shelter from surrounding terrain and trees  
- **Signs of Natural Disturbance:** Not clearly visible  
- **Signs of Human Influence/Management:** Possible signs of past or current grazing (low grass height); presence of a cut log or wooden debris in foreground  
- **Other Notable Features:** Mountain slope with sparse snow visible in background; tree line suggests potential elevational transition zone

**AI:** Based on your description of a terrestrial environment with mineral soil, dry conditions, and a mix of grassland and forest, the most suitable major type group is likely **[NA-T](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T) Fastmarkssystemer** (Terrestrial Systems).

Does [NA-T](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-T fit your site? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Okay, great. Moving to the next level, the description points towards open areas with signs of grazing on mineral soil within a terrestrial system.

Based on this, a likely Major Type is **[NA-TK01](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01) Semi-naturlig eng** (Semi-natural meadow). These areas are often open grasslands shaped by traditional management like grazing or mowing.

Does [NA-TK01](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01) fit your site description? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TK01 fit your site description? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** You've confirmed your site fits **[NA-TK01](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01) Semi-naturlig eng**. Now we need to narrow it down further based on specific characteristics like calcium content and moisture.

Within Semi-natural meadows ([NA-TK01](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01)), the calcium content of the soil and rocks is a key characteristic.

Based on the rocks and soil at your site, would you describe the calcium content as low, medium, or high? (low/medium/high/unsure)

**Human:** Question: Based on the rocks and soil at your site, do you know the calcium content (low, medium, or high), or are you unsure? 
Answer: I am unsure

**AI:** Okay, no problem. Knowing the calcium content of the soil and rocks is often important for classifying down to the most specific level.

We can look for indicator plants that tell us about the calcium levels.

Species like wild thyme (*Thymus serpyllum*) often thrive in calcium-rich soils.

Do you see wild thyme or similar low, mat-forming plants with small, often purple, flowers? (yes/no)

**Human:** There is viola here

**AI:** Thanks for the information. The presence of Viola species can often indicate that the soil is more calcium-rich.

Based on this, a likely mapping unit is **[TK01-M005-15](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TK01-M005-15) Klart kalkrik Ã¥pen semi-naturlig ikke markryddet eng** (Clearly calcium-rich open semi-natural uncultivated meadow) or similar calcium-rich types within [NA-TK01](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01).

Does [TK01-M005-15](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TK01-M005-15) fit your site? (yes/no)
