  - Mosses (~30%)  
  - Dwarf shrubs and/or low herbs/forbs (~20%)  
  - Grasses (~10%)

- **Identifiable Plant Species:**  
  - Cannot determine with certainty; some mosses and possible presence of conifer seedlings or saplings.

- **Surface Features/Topography:**  
  - Slightly sloping terrain  
  - Irregular ground surface with low hummocks and minor elevation variation

- **Exposure:**  
  - Appears moderately sheltered by tree cover; limited exposure to wind

- **Signs of Natural Disturbance:**  
  - Not clearly visible

- **Signs of Human Influence/Management:**  
  - No clear signs of recent human activity or management in the visible area

- **Other Notable Features:**  
  - None visibly notable beyond vegetation layers and ground cover

**AI:** Based on your description of a terrestrial environment with forest cover, moss, litter, and an open canopy, the major type group that best fits is [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T).

Does this fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Based on your description of a terrestrial environment with forest cover, moss, litter, and an open canopy, does the major type group NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer) fit your site? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Okay, thank you. Based on your description of a forest environment, the next level, Hovedtype, that seems to fit is [NA-TB01 (Fastmarksskogsmark)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TB01).

Does this fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Based on your description of a forest environment, the next level, Hovedtype, that seems to fit is NA-TB01 (Fastmarksskogsmark). Does this fit your site? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Okay, glad we are on the right track with Fastmarksskogsmark.

Now, let's look closer at the specific type of forest floor. Your description mentions moss, litter, dwarf shrubs/low herbs, and grasses.

Blueberry forest ([TB01-M005-01](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TB01-M005-01)) is characterized by the dominance of blueberry (*Vaccinium myrtillus*) in the understorey.

Is blueberry (*Vaccinium myrtillus*) the most common dwarf shrub or herb in the understorey? (yes/no/uncertain)
