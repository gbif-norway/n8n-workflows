**AI:** Okay, thank you for the detailed description. Based on the terrestrial environment, mineral soil with no standing water, and the mix of grass, trees, and shrubs, your site clearly belongs to the Fastmarkssystemer.

Does [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtypesystem/V2.1/NA-T) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer) fit your site? 
Answer: yes

**AI:** You've confirmed the site is a [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtypesystem/V2.1/NA-T).

Based on your description of open grass-dominated areas transitioning into scattered tree cover, and possible evidence of past clearing, the next likely level is areas that were previously forest but are now more open.

Does [NA-TH01 (Avskoget hei og eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtypesystem/V2.1/NA-T-A-TH01) fit this description? It covers deforested heath and meadow types. (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Based on the description of open grass-dominated areas transitioning into scattered tree cover with possible evidence of past clearing, does NA-TH01 (Avskoget hei og eng) fit this description? 
Answer: No, it does not fit.

**AI:** Okay, if [NA-TH01 (Avskoget hei og eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtypesystem/V2.1/NA-T-A-TH01) doesn't fit, let's consider other possibilities within [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtypesystem/V2.1/NA-T).

Your description mentions a site dominated by grasses with scattered trees and possible signs of past land use. This sounds like it could be a meadow maintained by traditional practices.

Does [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtypesystem/V2.1/NA-T-A-TK01) fit your site? This type includes meadows shaped by historical management like mowing or grazing. (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Considering the discussion about NA-TH01 (Avskoget hei og eng) within NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer), and your description mentioning a site dominated by grasses with scattered trees and possible signs of past land use, which sounds like it could be a meadow maintained by traditional practices, does NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng), which includes meadows shaped by historical management like mowing or grazing, fit your site? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** You've confirmed that the site is a [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtypesystem/V2.1/NA-T-A-TK01). To determine the specific mapping unit, we need to understand the soil's calcium level. Indicator plants are often the easiest way to tell.

Certain plants thrive in calcium-rich soils, while others prefer calcium-poor conditions.

Based on typical species found in these habitats, is Common Bird's-foot Trefoil (*Lotus corniculatus*) or Kidney Vetch (*Anthyllis vulneraria*) present at your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Based on typical species found in these habitats, is Common Bird's-foot Trefoil (Lotus corniculatus) or Kidney Vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria) present at your site? 
Answer: No

**AI:** Okay, the absence of those species suggests your site is likely not clearly calcium-rich.

To distinguish between calcium-poor and slightly calcium-rich semi-natural meadows, we can look for plants that prefer slightly less acidic conditions.

Is Wild Thyme (*Thymus serpyllum*) present at your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Is Wild Thyme (Thymus serpyllum) present at your site? 
Answer: No, Wild Thyme is not present

**AI:** Okay, the absence of Wild Thyme further supports the site being on the calcium-poor side.

Based on the lack of calcium-indicator species you've mentioned, the presence of scattered trees (an "open tree layer"), and the dry to moist conditions you described, the most fitting basic type is a calcium-poor semi-natural meadow with an open tree layer.
