**Human:** - **General Environment:** Terrestrial  
- **Substrate Type:** Mineral soil with patches of organic litter; finer textures dominant (likely loamy or silty mineral substrate)  
- **Moisture/Water Presence:** Moist ground; no standing or running water visible  
- **Vegetation Structure:** Dense low vegetation (grass-dominated ground layer)  
- **Dominant Plant Growth Forms:** Grasses (~80%), Herbs/Forbs (~10%), Sparse presence of dead leaves from previous vegetation (~10%)  
- **Identifiable Plant Species:** Not clearly identifiable from image (grasses present but unidentifiable at this resolution)  
- **Surface Features/Topography:** Flat to gently sloping terrain; no prominent surface features visible  
- **Exposure:** Appears relatively sheltered; no visible signs of wind desiccation or wave exposure  
- **Signs of Natural Disturbance:** Not clearly visible  
- **Signs of Human Influence/Management:** Possible mowing or grazing (short, uniform grass height suggests prior cutting or grazing pressure)  
- **Other Notable Features:** Presence of dry fallen leaves scattered throughout, indicating nearby or past deciduous vegetation

**AI:** Based on your description of a terrestrial site with moist mineral soil, dense low grass vegetation, and signs of possible mowing or grazing, the most likely major type group is [NA-T] (Fastmarkssystemer).

**Human:** Question: Does NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng) fit your site? 
Answer: yes

**AI:** Okay, confirming the major type is [NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01] (Semi-naturlig eng).

Based on your description of moist, grass-dominated ground with possible mowing or grazing, a likely basic type is a slightly calcium-rich open semi-natural meadow without ground clearing.

Approve [NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TK01-M005-14] (Svakt kalkrik Ã¥pen semi-naturlig ikke markryddet eng) as the basic type? (yes/no)
