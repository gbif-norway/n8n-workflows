**Human:** Do you have any other suggestions?

**AI:** Yes, I can help you classify a site using the Nature in Index (NIN) system, but I need a description of the site first.

Please tell me about the site you are interested in. Include details you observe in the field, such as:
- What kind of plants dominate (e.g., trees, shrubs, mosses, grasses)?
- What is the ground like (e.g., rocky, sandy, wet, dry, spongy)?
- What is the water regime (e.g., always wet, sometimes flooded, dry)?
- Is it a forest, open area, wetland, or aquatic environment?
- Are there any specific features (e.g., steep slope, near the coast, signs of disturbance)?

Once I have a description, I can propose the most likely NIN ecosystem type starting with the highest level (Hovedtypegruppe).
