**AI:** Okay, thank you. Based on your description, particularly the combination of bare bedrock, shallow soil, open ground, and the dominance of lichens and mosses, the most likely major type within Fastmarkssystemer is [NA-TA02 (Åpen grunnlendt mark)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TA02). This type covers open areas with thin soil layers over bedrock or coarse material, often dominated by lichens, mosses, and low vegetation.

**AI:** Based on your description of a terrestrial environment with bare bedrock, loose material, open ground, and vegetation dominated by lichens, mosses, and dwarf shrubs, the most likely major type group is [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T) (Terrestrial systems). This group includes various land ecosystems on solid ground or loose material, not primarily shaped by water saturation, snow/ice, or marine influences.

Does [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T) fit your site description? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer) fit your site description? 
Answer: Yes

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TA02 (Åpen grunnlendt mark) fit your site, yes or no? 
Answer: no

**AI:** Okay, I understand. Let's look at other possibilities within [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T).

Your description mentions a mountainous background and vegetation dominated by lichens and dwarf shrubs, which is characteristic of alpine or arctic-alpine heaths.

Does [NA-TA03 (Arktisk-alpin hei og leside)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TA03) better fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TA03 (Arktisk-alpin hei og leside) better fit your site? 
Answer: yes

**AI:** Okay, you have confirmed [NA-TA03 (Arktisk-alpin hei og leside)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TA03) as the Hovedtype.

Your initial description noted a high cover of lichens, especially reindeer lichens (Cladonia spp.), which often thrive in calcium-poor conditions typical of lichen heaths.

Areas with low calcium typically have few flowering plants and sedges.

Are flowering plants and sedges mostly absent, with the vegetation dominated by lichens, mosses, and dwarf shrubs? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: For the NA-TA03 (Arktisk-alpin hei og leside) area, is it true that flowering plants and sedges are mostly absent, with the vegetation dominated by lichens, mosses, and dwarf shrubs? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Thank you. The high cover of lichens and the absence of flowering plants and sedges strongly suggest a calcium-poor lichen heath within the arctic-alpine zone.

Based on these characteristics, the most likely mapping unit is [TA03-M005-08 (Kalkfattig fjell-lavhei)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TA03-M005-08). This type is defined by calcium-poor conditions and dominance of lichens in arctic-alpine areas.

Does [TA03-M005-08 (Kalkfattig fjell-lavhei)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TA03-M005-08) match your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does TA03-M005-08 (Kalkfattig fjell-lavhei) match your site? 
Answer: I don't know.

**AI:** Okay, no problem. To help you decide if [TA03-M005-08 (Kalkfattig fjell-lavhei)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TA03-M005-08) is the correct fit, let's look closer at its key features based on the documentation.

[TA03-M005-08 (Kalkfattig fjell-lavhei)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TA03-M005-08) is characterized by a high cover of lichens (like reindeer lichens, *Cladonia* spp., and others) and often dwarf shrubs, but with flowering plants and sedges being scarce due to low calcium in the soil.

Another common type in alpine areas is mountain dwarf-shrub heath, where dwarf shrubs are dominant.

To differentiate between lichen heath and dwarf-shrub heath, consider the overall vegetation cover.

Is the ground cover clearly dominated by lichens (crusty, leafy, or branching like reindeer lichen) and mosses, with dwarf shrubs (like crowberry, blueberry, or heather) having significantly less cover than the lichens and mosses combined? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Considering TA03-M005-08 (Kalkfattig fjell-lavhei), characterized by high cover of lichens and often dwarf shrubs, with scarce flowering plants and sedges, and differentiating it from mountain dwarf-shrub heath where dwarf shrubs are dominant: Is the ground cover clearly dominated by lichens (crusty, leafy, or branching like reindeer lichen) and mosses, with dwarf shrubs (like crowberry, blueberry, or heather) having significantly less cover than the lichens and mosses combined? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Thank you for confirming the dominance of lichens and mosses over dwarf shrubs.

Key indicators—arctic-alpine setting ([NA-TA03](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TA03)), scarcity of flowering plants and sedges (suggesting calcium-poor conditions), and clear dominance of lichens and mosses over dwarf shrubs—all strongly support the classification as a calcium-poor lichen heath.

Confirmed type: [TA03-M005-08 (Kalkfattig fjell-lavhei)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TA03-M005-08)
