**Human:** Question: Would you describe the soil as clearly calcareous (fizzes with acid or contains many known lime-loving plants)? 
Answer: No

**Human:** Question: Does NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer) fit your site now that you've described it as a garden? 
Answer: I don't know.

**Human:** Engsyre, hundekjeks, hvitkløver, forglemmegei, engkransmose

**AI:** Based on the species you listed (Engsyre, hundekjeks, hvitkløver, forglemmegei, engkransmose), the site sounds like a type of grassland or meadow.

Does [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA) fit your site? This group includes various types of dry land systems, including grasslands and meadows. (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer) fit your site? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Okay, great. Within [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA), the species you mentioned (Engsyre, hundekjeks, hvitkløver, forglemmegei, engkransmose) are commonly found in semi-natural grasslands, which are shaped by historical land use like mowing or grazing.

Does [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA-TK01) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng) fit your site? 
Answer: I don't know.

**AI:** Okay. The species you mentioned are typical of grasslands or meadows. There are a few different types of grasslands within [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA).

Semi-natural meadows ([NA-TK01](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA-TK01)) are traditionally managed by mowing, while naturally grazed meadows ([NA-TD05](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA-TD05)) are primarily shaped by grazing.

Has this area been regularly mown in the past? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Has this area been regularly mown in the past? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Okay. Since the area has been regularly mown, [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA-TK01) is a very strong candidate. To find the specific type within that, we need more details about the site's structure.

Explain: The amount of tree cover significantly changes the type of semi-natural meadow.
Question: Is there an open layer of trees (more than 10% cover) over the meadow? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Is there an open layer of trees (more than 10% cover) over the meadow? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Okay, we've confirmed [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA-TK01) with an open tree layer. Now let's look at the soil properties.

Explain: The amount of calcium in the soil affects which plants can grow there, influencing the specific type of meadow.
Question: Would you describe the soil as clearly calcareous (fizzes with acid or contains many known lime-loving plants)? (yes/no)

**AI:** Okay. Since the soil is not clearly calcareous, we can narrow it down further within [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA-TK01) with an open tree layer.

Explain: Soil disturbance, such as from digging or recent heavy machinery, changes the ground structure and plant communities.
Question: Is there evidence of recent significant soil disturbance in the meadow? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Is there evidence of recent significant soil disturbance in the meadow? 
Answer: no

**AI:** Based on the information that the area is a semi-natural meadow that has been regularly mown, has an open tree layer, is not clearly calcareous, and has no recent significant soil disturbance, the most likely type is a calcareous-poor, non-disturbed semi-natural meadow with an open tree layer.

**Human:** Question: Based on the information that the area is a semi-natural meadow that has been regularly mown, has an open tree layer, is not clearly calcareous, and has no recent significant soil disturbance, does TK01-M005-01 (Kalkfattig semi-naturlig eng uten markrydding med åpent tresjikt) fit your site? 
Answer: no

**AI:** Okay, thank you for clarifying. We've established the site is [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA-TK01) with an open tree layer and no recent significant soil disturbance.

We previously considered the "Kalkfattig" option (TK01-M005-01), which you rejected. The next likely options depend on the calcium content being slightly higher.

Explain: The calcium content of the soil influences the plant life. While not *clearly* calcareous, it might have some level of calcium enrichment.
Question: Does the soil feel slightly gritty and potentially contain small shell fragments, or are there plants present that are known to prefer somewhat calcium-rich soil (even if not extremely calcium-demanding)? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does the soil feel slightly gritty and potentially contain small shell fragments, or are there plants present that are known to prefer somewhat calcium-rich soil (even if not extremely calcium-demanding)? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Based on your description of a semi-natural meadow ([NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA-TK01)) that is regularly mown, has an open tree layer, no recent significant soil disturbance, and soil indicating some calcium enrichment (not clearly calcareous, but not extremely poor), the specific type is clear.

Confirmed type: [TK01-M005-02 (Svakt kalkrik semi-naturlig ikke markryddet eng med åpent tresjikt)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TK01-M005-02)

- Understand typical management history (mowing, grazing) for semi-natural types.

**Human:** No, it is not a meadow. It is a garden

**AI:** Thank you for clarifying that the site is a garden and not a meadow. My apologies for the previous incorrect path.

Based on your description of the site as a garden, it falls under types influenced by human activity.

Does [NA-TN (Annen fastmark påvirket av samfunnsutvikling)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA-TN) fit your site? This Hovedtype includes areas like gardens, parks, and other types of urban or semi-urban vegetation. (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TN (Annen fastmark påvirket av samfunnsutvikling) fit your site? 
Answer: I don't know.

**AI:** Okay, let's look at why [NA-TN (Annen fastmark påvirket av samfunnsutvikling)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA-TN) might fit. This group includes dry land areas that are shaped or significantly influenced by human activity and societal development, which is typical for gardens.

Does [NA-TN (Annen fastmark påvirket av samfunnsutvikling)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA-TN) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** What defines na-tn?

**AI:** Thank you for clarifying that it's a garden. I apologize for the previous confusion and for suggesting meadow types.

My tool search for "NA-TN Hovedtypegruppe" didn't find a direct match because [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA) is the main Hovedtypegruppe for dry land, and types related to gardens fall within this group.

[NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA) includes dry land habitats, whether natural or influenced by human activity. Since a garden is a human-influenced dry land area, this Hovedtypegruppe fits.

Does [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA) fit your site now that you've described it as a garden? (yes/no)

**AI:** Thank you for providing the tool output. It confirms that NA-TN is indeed a Hovedtype within the NIN 3.0 system, covering areas like flower meadows and similar sites under semi-natural management (NA-TN02). However, gardens can include other types of human-influenced ground.

We know the site is a garden, which is a type of dry land influenced by human activity. This fits the overall Hovedtypegruppe [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA).

Now, let's figure out the specific Hovedtype within NA-T that best describes your garden. Different types of gardens have different levels and kinds of human intervention.

Explain: Gardens can range from areas with frequent soil disturbance (like flower beds) to less intensively managed areas like lawns. This difference in management helps classify them.
Question: Is the main part of your garden actively cultivated with frequent digging, planting of annuals, or similar soil disturbance? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Is the main part of your garden actively cultivated with frequent digging, planting of annuals, or similar soil disturbance? 
Answer: no

**AI:** Okay, thank you for clarifying that the main part of your garden is not actively cultivated with frequent digging or annuals. This rules out types like flower beds.

Since it's a garden, it falls under dry land influenced by human activity, confirming that the Hovedtypegruppe [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA) is correct.

Now, we need to determine the specific Hovedtype within NA-T that fits your garden, considering it's not a cultivated bed. Gardens can be managed in different ways beyond active cultivation.

Explain: Areas in gardens that aren't actively cultivated are often maintained as lawns through frequent mowing, while others are managed less often, which can lead to a more diverse plant community, similar to a semi-natural meadow.
Question: Is the main uncultivated area of your garden typically mown frequently like a lawn, or is it managed less often, allowing a wider variety of plants to grow? (frequently mown lawn / less intensively managed)

**Human:** Question: Is the main uncultivated area of your garden typically mown frequently like a lawn, or is it managed less often, allowing a wider variety of plants to grow? 
Answer: frequently mown lawn

**AI:** Okay, thank you. Knowing the main uncultivated area is a frequently mown lawn helps a lot.

The site is still within the [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA) Hovedtypegruppe, as it's dry land influenced by human activity (a garden).

Based on your description of a frequently mown lawn, the most fitting Hovedtype is one that includes such managed green spaces.

Does [NA-TN03 (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA-TN03) fit your site? This includes areas like lawns, parks, and road verges that are regularly mown and don't have semi-natural management characteristics. (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TN03 (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg), which includes areas like lawns, parks, and road verges that are regularly mown and don't have semi-natural management characteristics, fit your site? 
Answer: I don't know.

**AI:** Okay, let's clarify why [NA-TN03 (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA-TN03) is the likely fit for a frequently mown lawn in a garden.

This Hovedtype specifically covers areas that are regularly managed, such as by frequent mowing, and are *not* managed to encourage a diverse plant community typical of semi-natural grasslands (like hay meadows). A standard lawn in a garden fits this description because its primary management is frequent cutting, which prevents taller plants and many flowering species from establishing, unlike a semi-natural meadow.

Does [NA-TN03 (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA-TN03), which is defined by regular mowing and the absence of management for semi-natural characteristics, fit your site which you described as a frequently mown lawn within a garden? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Based on its definition as covering regularly managed areas like frequently mown lawns that are not managed for semi-natural characteristics, is NA-TN03 (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg) the appropriate classification for a frequently mown lawn within a garden? 
Answer: Yes, it is the appropriate classification.

**AI:** Thank you for confirming that [NA-TN03 (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA-TN03) is the appropriate Hovedtype for your site.

Based on your description of a frequently mown lawn in a garden, which fits the definition of [NA-TN03 (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA-TN03) as a regularly managed area without semi-natural characteristics, the specific mapping unit is also clear.
