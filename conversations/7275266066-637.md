**Human:** - **General Environment:** Terrestrial  
- **Substrate Type:** Mineral soil (covered by a maintained grass layer; underlying soil type not fully visible)  
- **Moisture/Water Presence:** Dry to moist ground (no visible standing water or signs of waterlogging)  
- **Vegetation Structure:** Dense low vegetation (maintained grass layer)  
- **Dominant Plant Growth Forms:** Grasses (~90%), with minor presence of herbs/forbs (~10%)  
- **Identifiable Plant Species:** Not clearly identifiable from the image  
- **Surface Features/Topography:** Flat  
- **Exposure:** Appears sheltered (no visible indicators of strong wind exposure)  
- **Signs of Natural Disturbance:** None visible  
- **Signs of Human Influence/Management:** Mown grass (evidence of regular cutting or mowing), possibly indicative of a managed lawn or maintained area  
- **Other Notable Features:** Small stones or rocks in upper corners; no ecologically significant features observed

**AI:** Okay, thank you for the details. Based on your description of a terrestrial environment with mineral soil, it sounds like your site belongs to the **Fastmarkssystemer** group.

Does [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer) fit your site? 
Answer: yes

**AI:** You've confirmed **NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)** as the major type group.

Based on your description of a maintained grass layer and evidence of regular mowing, it sounds like your site falls within the category of cultural landscapes or managed ground.

Does [NA-TN (Kulturmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TN) fit your site as the main type? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TN (Kulturmarkssystemer) fit your site as the main type? 
Answer: I don't know.

**AI:** Okay, let's clarify. [NA-TN (Kulturmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TN) includes areas significantly influenced by human use and management, such as regular mowing.

Is your site an area like a lawn, park, or roadside verge that is regularly managed by mowing or similar activities? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Considering that NA-TN (Kulturmarkssystemer) includes areas significantly influenced by human use and management, such as regular mowing, is your site an area like a lawn, park, or roadside verge that is regularly managed by mowing or similar activities? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** You've confirmed your site is a regularly managed area like a lawn, park, or roadside verge.

Based on this and your description of a maintained grass layer (around 90% grass), the most appropriate mapping unit is [TN03-M005-01 (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TN03-M005-01), which covers road verges, lawns, and parks without semi-natural management characteristics.

Confirmed type: [TN03-M005-01](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TN03-M005-01) (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg)
Confidence: High

Mentioning how my tools could be more useful: Providing more detailed species identification or specific management practices (e.g., how often it's mown, if any fertilizers are used) would allow for potentially finer-scale classification within the managed land types, if such distinctions exist in the documentation. Access to visual characteristics like flower abundance could also help differentiate between lawn/park and semi-natural meadow types.
