**Human:** - **General Environment:** Terrestrial  
- **Substrate Type:** Bare bedrock (dominant), scattered areas with shallow mineral soil  
- **Moisture/Water Presence:** Dry; no visible water or signs of recent moisture  
- **Vegetation Structure:** Sparse vegetation mainly confined to cracks and ledges in the rock face  
- **Dominant Plant Growth Forms:** Shrubs (~40%), Dwarf shrubs (~20%), Mosses (~10%)  
- **Identifiable Plant Species:** Not clearly identifiable from image; general forms suggest possible presence of juniper or other hardy shrub species typical of rocky alpine or coastal environments  
- **Surface Features/Topography:** Steep to vertical rock face with angular bedrock, ledges, and overhangs; deeply fissured  
- **Exposure:** Appears highly exposed to wind and sun; no canopy or terrain shielding  
- **Signs of Natural Disturbance:** No clear signs visible (e.g., no fresh rockfalls or erosion trails apparent)  
- **Signs of Human Influence/Management:** Presence of a climbing rope or cable secured to the rock face suggests recreational use (rock climbing)  
- **Other Notable Features:** Vertical cliff habitat likely includes microhabitats in rock fissures and ledges; potential niches for birds or heat-tolerant plant species

**AI:** Based on your description of a terrestrial site with dominant bare bedrock and dry conditions, it sounds like it falls under the **Fastmarkssystemer** major type group.

Does [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0/NA-T) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer) fit the description of the site? 
Answer: Yes, it fits.

**AI:** Great! Within Fastmarkssystemer, your description of dominant bare bedrock, steep to vertical rock face, ledges, and overhangs strongly suggests the "Bare rock" major type.

Does [NA-TA01 (Nakent berg)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0/NA-TA01) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TA01 (Nakent berg) fit your site: Yes or No? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Calcium content is the key factor to distinguish between different types of bare rock with similar exposure.

When you put a drop of vinegar (or weak acid) on the rock surface, does it fizz or bubble noticeably, indicating high calcium content? (yes/no/unsure)

**Human:** Question: When a drop of vinegar (or weak acid) is applied to the bare rock surface, does it fizz or bubble noticeably, indicating high calcium content? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** The fizzing confirms high calcium content in the bedrock, directing us towards calcium-rich bare rock types. Combined with the site's high exposure, [TA01-M005-16 (Svært uttørkingseksponert klart kalkrikt nakent berg)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TA01-M005-16) is a likely fit.

Approve [TA01-M005-16 (Svært uttørkingseksponert klart kalkrikt nakent berg)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TA01-M005-16) as the mapping unit? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Should TA01-M005-16 (Svært uttørkingseksponert klart kalkrikt nakent berg) be approved as the mapping unit? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Confirmed type: [TA01-M005-16](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TA01-M005-16) (Svært uttørkingseksponert klart kalkrikt nakent berg)
Confidence: High
