**Human:** - **General Environment:** Terrestrial  
- **Substrate Type:** Mineral soil with a cover of grass; some dry organic litter visible  
- **Moisture/Water Presence:** Appears dry to moderately moist; no standing or visible water  
- **Vegetation Structure:** Dense low vegetation (grass-dominated), with isolated herbaceous plants  
- **Dominant Plant Growth Forms:** Grasses (~80%), Herbs/Forbs (~15%), Minimal presence of mosses (~5%)  
- **Identifiable Plant Species:** A flower morphologically consistent with *Viola* sp. (e.g., *Viola tricolor*) visible in foreground  
- **Surface Features/Topography:** Flat to gently sloping terrain  
- **Exposure:** Appears moderately sheltered (surrounding trees in the background)  
- **Signs of Natural Disturbance:** Not clearly visible  
- **Signs of Human Influence/Management:** Cannot determine from image  
- **Other Notable Features:** Presence of coniferous trees in the background suggests ecotone between grassland and forest

**AI:** Based on your description of a terrestrial environment with mineral soil, grass cover, dry to moderately moist conditions, and no standing water, it sounds like a Fastmarkssystem (terrestrial system).

Does [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer) fit your site? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Okay, acknowledging that the site is a [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T).

Based on the grass dominance and presence of flowering herbs, a likely fit is Semi-natural grassland, which are often shaped by historical mowing or grazing.

Does [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng) fit your site? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Okay, the site is confirmed as [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01). This type includes grasslands managed historically by mowing or grazing.

Your description mentions the site is "dry to moderately moist". Within semi-natural grasslands, moisture level is a key factor in determining the specific mapping unit.

Semi-natural meadows (eng) are typically fresh to moderately moist, while dry meadows (tÃ¸rreng) are drier.

Does the ground feel consistently moist, or does it tend to dry out quickly after rain? (consistently moist/dries out quickly)

**Human:** Question: Does the ground feel consistently moist, or does it tend to dry out quickly after rain? 
Answer: consistently moist

**AI:** Okay, acknowledging that the site is a [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01) and the ground is consistently moist.

Calcium richness is a key factor in distinguishing types of semi-natural meadow. Certain plant species indicate higher calcium levels in the soil.

Is *Viola tricolor* (or other similar low-growing purple/yellow flowers) present in abundance (>5% cover), or is it just a few scattered plants? (abundant/scattered)
