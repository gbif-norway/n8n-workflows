**Human:** - **General Environment:** Terrestrial  
- **Substrate Type:** Mineral soil (covered by vegetation)  
- **Moisture/Water Presence:** Appears dry to slightly moist ground; no visible surface water  
- **Vegetation Structure:** Dense low vegetation (grass-dominated ground layer with patches of herbs/forbs)  
- **Dominant Plant Growth Forms:** Grasses (~70%), Herbs/Forbs (~20%), Mosses (<10%)  
- **Identifiable Plant Species:** Possible presence of *Myosotis* species (Forget-me-nots) based on small blue flowers  
- **Surface Features/Topography:** Flat to very gently sloping terrain  
- **Exposure:** Appears moderately sheltered; no signs of strong wind or wave exposure  
- **Signs of Natural Disturbance:** Not clearly visible  
- **Signs of Human Influence/Management:** Possibly managed grassed area (e.g., mowing); uniform grass cover suggests human maintenance  
- **Other Notable Features:** None clearly visible

**AI:** Based on your description of a terrestrial site with mineral soil and vegetation, the most likely major type group is [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0/T-C/PE/NA/MB/NA-T).
