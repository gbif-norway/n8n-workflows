**Human:** - **General Environment:** Terrestrial  
- **Substrate Type:** Dominantly moss-covered soil; likely underlying mineral soil with organic surface layer  
- **Moisture/Water Presence:** Moist ground; no visible standing or running water  
- **Vegetation Structure:** Forest; predominantly coniferous trees with dense moss layer on forest floor  
- **Dominant Plant Growth Forms:** Trees (~50%), Mosses (~40%), Fungi/Fruiting bodies (~10%)  
- **Identifiable Plant Species:** Not clearly identifiable to species level; moss carpet and possible Picea (spruce) trees  
- **Surface Features/Topography:** Generally flat with minor undulations formed by moss mats and tree bases; some fallen logs visible  
- **Exposure:** Appears sheltered; enclosed forest limits direct wind exposure  
- **Signs of Natural Disturbance:** Fallen tree trunks suggest natural treefall  
- **Signs of Human Influence/Management:** No clear evidence of recent human influence or management in the visible area  
- **Other Notable Features:** Presence of several mushroom/fungal fruiting bodies around tree bases, indicating decomposing organic material and likely well-developed forest soil processes

**AI:** Okay, let's start by classifying the major type group for your site based on your description.

Based on your description of a terrestrial forest environment, the most probable major type group is [NA-T](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0/NA-T) (Fastmarkssystemer). This group includes terrestrial environments like forests and heaths.

Does [NA-T](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0/NA-T) (Fastmarkssystemer) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer) fit your site? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Great. Now let's narrow it down to the Hovedtype within Fastmarkssystemer.

Based on your description of a forest environment with trees and a moss layer, the most likely Hovedtype is [NA-TB01](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0/NA-TB01) (Fastmarksskogsmark).

Does [NA-TB01](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0/NA-TB01) (Fastmarksskogsmark) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TB01 (Fastmarksskogsmark) fit your site? 
Answer: yes

**AI:** Okay, we're in the right major type group and hovedtype. Now let's identify the specific mapping unit within [NA-TB01](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0/NA-TB01) (Fastmarksskogsmark).

Based on your description of a forest with a dense moss layer and moist ground, [TB01-M005-13](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TB01-M005-13) (Blåbærfuktskog) is a strong candidate as it specifically refers to moist blueberry forest.

Does [TB01-M005-13](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TB01-M005-13) (Blåbærfuktskog) fit your site? (yes/no)
