**Human:** - **General Environment:** Terrestrial  
- **Substrate Type:** Mineral soil with sparse litter cover; fine to medium-textured soil inferred from dense grass growth  
- **Moisture/Water Presence:** Moist ground; no visible surface water but vegetation suggests adequate soil moisture  
- **Vegetation Structure:** Dense low vegetation (grassland/herb meadow character); scattered woody background elements suggest ecotone toward forest  
- **Dominant Plant Growth Forms:** Grasses (~70%), Herbs/Forbs (~20%), Mosses (~5%), Dwarf shrubs (Not clearly visible or absent)  
- **Identifiable Plant Species:** One species of violet (likely Viola sp., based on leaf and flower morphology)  
- **Surface Features/Topography:** Flat to gently sloping terrain; no large surface formations visible  
- **Exposure:** Appears moderately exposed; no strong signs of wind or wave erosion—suggests open site but within a partially wooded area  
- **Signs of Natural Disturbance:** Not clearly visible  
- **Signs of Human Influence/Management:** Possible mowing or grazing (even grass height, lack of woody regrowth)  
- **Other Notable Features:** Presence of early flowering forbs suggests spring season or early successional grassland stage

**AI:** Thank you for the detailed description. Based on the characteristics you provided – terrestrial, mineral soil, dense low vegetation dominated by grasses and herbs, signs of potential management like mowing or grazing, and located below the treeline (implied by scattered woody elements) – the most probable major type within Fastmarkssystemer (NA-T) is one influenced by historical management.

Does [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01) fit your site? This type includes culture historical semi-natural meadows resulting from long-term harvesting like mowing or grazing. (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Based on the characteristics you provided, does NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng) fit your site? 
Answer: Yes, it fits the site.

**AI:** Okay, that confirms [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01) as the correct major type. Now let's narrow down the specific mapping unit.

To distinguish between the different types of semi-natural meadows, the calcium content of the soil is a key factor.

Does the soil fizz if you drop a small amount of dilute acid (like vinegar) on it? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does the soil fizz if you drop a small amount of dilute acid (like vinegar) on it? 
Answer: I don't know.

**AI:** That's alright. We can use plants as indicators for soil calcium content. Some plants prefer calcium-rich soils, while others are found in calcium-poor conditions.

Finding *Anthyllis vulneraria* (Kidney Vetch) often indicates higher calcium levels in the soil.

Is *Anthyllis vulneraria* present at your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Is Anthyllis vulneraria present at your site? 
Answer: No

**AI:** Okay, *Anthyllis vulneraria* is absent. This suggests the site is likely not clearly kalkrik (calcareous).

The amount of calcium in the soil affects which plants grow there. *Leucanthemum vulgare* (Ox-eye Daisy) is often found in meadows with slightly more calcium.

Is *Leucanthemum vulgare* (Ox-eye Daisy) present at your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Is Leucanthemum vulgare (Ox-eye Daisy) present at your site? 
Answer: No

**AI:** Okay, the absence of *Anthyllis vulneraria* and *Leucanthemum vulgare* suggests the soil is likely not rich in calcium.

To help determine if it's a calcium-poor meadow, we can look for indicator species that thrive in those conditions and clarify the tree cover.

Explain: Calcium-poor meadows often have heather. Also, does the meadow area itself have scattered trees?
Question: Is *Calluna vulgaris* (Heather) present, and is there an open tree layer (10-30% canopy cover) within the meadow area? (yes to both / yes to heather only / yes to tree layer only / no to both)

**Human:** Question: Are both Calluna vulgaris (Heather) present AND is there an open tree layer (10-30% canopy cover) within the meadow area? 
Answer: No, at least one of these conditions is not met

**AI:** Okay, thank you. The absence of *Anthyllis* and *Leucanthemum* makes clearly calcareous types less likely. Your previous answer indicated that either *Calluna vulgaris* is absent or the tree cover is not 10-30%.

Semi-natural meadows can have varying amounts of tree cover. Some have a scattered layer of trees (10-30%), while others are more open (<10% tree cover).

Question: What is the approximate percentage of tree canopy cover over the meadow area? (<10% / 10-30% / >30%)

**Human:** Question: Is the approximate percentage of tree canopy cover over the meadow area less than 10% or is it 10% or more? 
Answer: 10% or more (>=10%)

**AI:** Okay, the tree canopy cover is 10% or more, and the absence of *Anthyllis* and *Leucanthemum* suggests the soil is not clearly rich in calcium. This points towards a semi-natural meadow with an open tree layer that is either calcium-poor or slightly calcareous.

Some plants are good indicators of slightly more calcium in the soil compared to calcium-poor conditions.

Explain: The presence of certain plant species can help distinguish between calcium-poor and slightly more calcium-rich meadows.
Question: Is *Pilosella officinarum* (Mouse-ear Hawkweed) present at your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Is Pilosella officinarum (Mouse-ear Hawkweed) present at your site? 
Answer: No

**AI:** Okay, you confirmed the tree canopy cover is 10% or more.

Semi-natural meadow types with tree cover typically have an *open* tree layer, which means the canopy cover is between 10% and 30%. If the tree cover is higher than 30%, it would usually be classified as a different type.

Explain: Semi-natural meadows with trees usually have an open canopy (10-30%).
Question: Is the tree canopy cover over the meadow area between 10% and 30%? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Is the tree canopy cover over the meadow area between 10% and 30%? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Okay, the tree canopy cover is confirmed to be between 10% and 30%, and the absence of key calcium indicator plants suggests the site is not clearly rich in calcium.

To differentiate between calcium-poor and slightly calcareous semi-natural meadows with an open tree layer, we can look for a common indicator of calcium-poor conditions.

Explain: Calcium-poor semi-natural meadows with an open tree layer often have species like Wavy Hair-grass.
Question: Is *Deschampsia flexuosa* (Wavy Hair-grass) present and common (e.g., covering more than 10% of the ground) at your site? (yes/no)
