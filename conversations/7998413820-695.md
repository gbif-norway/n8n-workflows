  Mineral soil with organic surface layer; presence of deadwood and leaf litter in wooded area; grassy cover in open area  

- **Moisture/Water Presence:**  
  Moist ground; no visible standing or running water; some areas may experience temporary wetness based on vegetation and color variation  

- **Vegetation Structure:**  
  Mosaic: edge habitat with dense low vegetation (grassland) and small tree/shrub stand (likely a hedgerow or field margin)  

- **Dominant Plant Growth Forms:**

  - Shrubs or young trees (~10%)  
  - Forbs/Herbs (~10%)  

- **Identifiable Plant Species:**  
  Not clearly identifiable to species level from image  

- **Surface Features/Topography:**  
  Generally flat to very gently sloping; presence of fallen branches and small wood debris; no prominent landforms  

- **Exposure:**  
  Appears moderately exposed to wind; no signs of protection or shelter; open field aspect with minimal windbreaks  

- **Signs of Natural Disturbance:**  
  None clearly visible  

- **Signs of Human Influence/Management:**  
  - Cut or managed grassland (possible mowing or grazing regime)  
  - Piled branches and wood debris suggesting human activity (e.g., clearing, edge maintenance)  
  - Possible agricultural or managed field adjacent to wooded margin  

- **Other Notable Features:**  
  Possible habitat boundary or ecotone between managed field and semi-natural tree/shrub margin

**AI:** Thank you for the detailed description. Based on the information you provided, particularly the terrestrial environment with moist ground but no standing water, and the mosaic of managed grassland and wooded areas, the site appears to fit within the [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T) major type group, which covers terrestrial systems that are not permanently water-saturated.

Does [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does the site described fit the NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer) major type group? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Based on your description of managed grassland with a tree/shrub margin and signs of human management, the site characteristics align well with the definition of semi-natural meadows or pastures.

Does [NA-TK (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TK (Semi-naturlig eng) fit your site? 
Answer: No

**AI:** Okay, thank you for clarifying. Since the site includes both managed grassland and a wooded/shrub stand with signs of human influence, it might fit better under a category that covers altered or managed terrestrial areas.

Based on the presence of a wooded component, management activities like clearing and piling, and the mosaic nature, [NA-TM06 (Sterkt endret skogsmark)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TM06) could be a more suitable fit. This type describes strongly altered forest ground, including intermediate successional stages after human intervention.

Does [NA-TM06 (Sterkt endret skogsmark)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TM06) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TM06 (Sterkt endret skogsmark) fit your site? 
Answer: I don't know.

**AI:** Okay, let's try another angle based on your description of the site having mineral soil, organic surface layer, and signs of human activity like cutting and piling. This suggests a terrestrial area with loose substrate that has been significantly altered by human influence.

[NA-TM03 (Løs sterkt endret fastmark)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TM03) covers strongly altered terrestrial ground with loose substrate. This could potentially include areas like field margins, where management creates a mosaic of vegetation types.

Does [NA-TM03 (Løs sterkt endret fastmark)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TM03) fit your site better? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TM03 (Løs sterkt endret fastmark) fit your site better? 
Answer: I don't know.

**AI:** Okay, thank you. Let's focus on the nature of the ground itself in the areas showing human influence.

[NA-TM03 (Løs sterkt endret fastmark)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TM03) describes strongly altered terrestrial ground with loose substrate, often a result of activities like digging or mixing soil layers. [NA-TM06 (Sterkt endret skogsmark)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TM06) focuses on forest ground that has been strongly altered.

Does the ground surface in the managed parts of your site feel dug up, mixed, or otherwise clearly disturbed, suggesting loose substrate rather than intact soil or forest floor? (yes/no)
