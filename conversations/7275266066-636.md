**AI:** Based on your description of a terrestrial site with mineral soil, sparse low vegetation dominated by grasses, and dry conditions, the most likely major type group is [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T). This group covers dry to moist land ecosystems.

- **Exposure:** Appears exposed; no tree cover or sheltering features visible  
- **Signs of Natural Disturbance:** No clear signs of natural disturbance visible  
- **Signs of Human Influence/Management:** Possible trampling or mowing suggested by patchy vegetation and bare spots, but no direct evidence of structures or tracks  
- **Other Notable Features:** Not clearly visible

**Human:** Question: Does NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer) fit your site? 
Answer: yes

**AI:** Okay, thank you. Let's narrow it down within [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T).

Based on your description mentioning mineral soil with scattered stones, patches of bare ground, and sparse low vegetation dominated by grasses, a likely candidate is [NA-TA02 (Åpen grunnlendt mark)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TA02). This type is characterized by thin or absent soil and open vegetation.

Does [NA-TA02 (Åpen grunnlendt mark)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TA02) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TA02 (Åpen grunnlendt mark) fit your site? 
Answer: No

**AI:** Okay, I see. [NA-TA02 (Åpen grunnlendt mark)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TA02) is typically very sparse vegetation on thin soil.

Your description mentioned grass dominance (~60%) and possible signs of trampling or mowing. This suggests a habitat where grass growth is favored and perhaps maintained by human activity. A type that fits this description is [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01), which covers grasslands maintained by traditional practices like grazing or mowing.

Does [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng) fit your site? 
Answer: No

**AI:** Okay, thank you. We've determined it's within [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T), but it's not clearly [NA-TA02 (Åpen grunnlendt mark)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TA02) (thin soil) or [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01) (traditional semi-natural meadow).

Your initial description mentioned possible trampling or mowing, which hints at some form of human influence impacting the vegetation structure.

Explain: Semi-natural meadows are shaped by practices like mowing or grazing. Your description mentioned possible trampling or mowing, let's clarify this.
Question: Are there clear signs of regular management like mowing (e.g., cut grass) or defined paths from heavy foot traffic or grazing? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Are there clear signs of regular management like mowing (e.g., cut grass) or defined paths from heavy foot traffic or grazing? 
Answer: yes

**AI:** Okay, the presence of clear signs of regular management like mowing or heavy foot traffic points towards a different type of managed grassland than traditional semi-natural meadows.

Explain: You confirmed signs of regular management like mowing or heavy foot traffic, which points towards areas like lawns, parks, or roadsides.
Question: Does [NA-TN03 (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TN03-M005-01) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TN03 (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg) fit your site? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** You've confirmed that the site fits [NA-TN03 (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TN03). This type includes areas like lawns, parks, and roadsides that are regularly managed but don't have the specific characteristics of traditional semi-natural meadows. The single mapping unit within this type is also [NA-TN03-M005-01 (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TN03-M005-01).

Confirmed type: [NA-TN03-M005-01](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TN03-M005-01) (Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg)
