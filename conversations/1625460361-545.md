**Human:** - **General Environment:** Terrestrial  
- **Substrate Type:** Mineral soil with a cover of grass and sparse organic litter  
- **Moisture/Water Presence:** Moist ground (inferred from green, healthy grass growth; no visible signs of waterlogging or dryness)  
- **Vegetation Structure:** Dense low vegetation (grassland-like structure) with scattered herbaceous plants; open ground with no tree canopy immediately overhead  
- **Dominant Plant Growth Forms:** Grasses (majority cover ~80–90%), Herbs/Forbs (notably one violet-flowered species, ~5%), Sparse Dwarf shrubs or other forms not clearly visible  
- **Identifiable Plant Species:** Possibly a Viola species (e.g., Viola riviniana or similar, based on violet flowers)  
- **Surface Features/Topography:** Flat to gently sloping ground  
- **Exposure:** Appears sheltered (no signs of wind stress or exposure indicators; presence of tree line in background suggesting some protection)  
- **Signs of Natural Disturbance:** Not clearly visible  
- **Signs of Human Influence/Management:** Possible signs of past mowing or light grazing inferred from grass density and even height—no direct evidence visible such as tracks or fences  
- **Other Notable Features:** Background includes deciduous and coniferous trees, suggesting proximity to forest edge or woodland transition zone

**AI:** Based on your description of a terrestrial site with mineral soil, moist but not waterlogged ground, and dense low grass vegetation, the most likely major type group is [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA).

**Human:** Question: Based on your description of a terrestrial site with mineral soil, moist but not waterlogged ground, and dense low grass vegetation, is the most likely major type group NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Great. Within [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA), semi-natural meadows are characterized by grassland vegetation often maintained by mowing or grazing, which fits your description of dense low grass vegetation and potential signs of management.
