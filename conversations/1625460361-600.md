**AI:** Based on your description, especially "Terrestrial" with "Mineral soil" and "Dense low vegetation, predominantly grassland", the major type group [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0/T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T) seems like a good fit. It covers ecosystems on solid ground.

Does [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0/T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer) fit your site? 
Answer: yes

**AI:** Okay, staying within the [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0/T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T) group, the description "predominantly grassland with scattered forbs" and "possible signs of mowing or light grazing" strongly suggests a type of meadow that is influenced by traditional land use.

Based on this, [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0/T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01) appears to be the most probable fit. This type covers grasslands maintained by human activities like mowing or grazing, but without intensive cultivation.

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng) fit your site? 
Answer: yes

**AI:** Okay, let's narrow it down further within [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0/T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01).

Your description of "predominantly grassland" on "moist ground" with "scattered forbs" points towards a fresh meadow type rather than a dry one (tørreng) or a wetter one (våteng or fukteng). The balance of grasses, herbs, and low moss/dwarf shrub cover also fits this.

A key factor differentiating meadow types is the calcium content of the soil (how 'kalk' rich it is). This influences which plant species can grow there.

Explain: Soil calcium level is a key feature distinguishing different meadow types within Semi-naturlig eng. Some species thrive in calcium-rich soil, while others prefer calcium-poor conditions.
Question: Do you see many plants like Kidney Vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), Mountain Everlasting (Antennaria dioica), or Hoary Rock-rose (Helianthemum canum), which often indicate calcium-rich conditions, or are species typical of more acidic soils more common? (e.g., Ling heather, Crowberry, or few calciphiles / yes, many calciphiles)

**Human:** Question: Within NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng), are plant species indicative of calcium-rich soil common, such as Kidney Vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), Mountain Everlasting (Antennaria dioica), or Hoary Rock-rose (Helianthemum canum)? 
Answer: No, species typical of more acidic soils are more common.

**AI:** Okay, the prevalence of species typical of acidic soils confirms we are looking at a calcium-poor variant of [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0/T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01).

Now we need to determine if it's a fully open meadow or one with scattered trees or shrubs. Your description mentions "background trees suggest habitat bordering woodland or forest edge".

Explain: Semi-natural meadows can be either completely open or have an open layer of scattered trees or shrubs. This affects the light conditions and the types of plants that thrive there.
Question: Is the grassland area completely open, or are there scattered trees or shrubs growing within the meadow itself? (completely open / scattered trees/shrubs present)

**Human:** Question: Is the grassland area completely open, or are there scattered trees or shrubs growing within the meadow itself, referencing the calcium-poor variant of NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)? 
Answer: scattered trees/shrubs present

**AI:** Thanks for the additional details. Within [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0/T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01), your observation of acidic-soil indicators and scattered trees/shrubs strongly points to a specific mapping unit.

Based on the calcium-poor conditions, the moist ground (not dry), and the presence of scattered trees within the meadow area, the most fitting type is [TK01-M005-01 (Kalkfattig semi-naturlig eng uten markrydding med åpent tresjikt)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0/T-C-PE-NA-MB-TK01-M005-01). This describes a calcium-poor semi-natural meadow that hasn't been significantly disturbed by ploughing or harrowing, and has an open tree layer.

Does [TK01-M005-01 (Kalkfattig semi-naturlig eng uten markrydding med åpent tresjikt)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0/T-C-PE-NA-MB-TK01-M005-01) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does TK01-M005-01 (Kalkfattig semi-naturlig eng uten markrydding med åpent tresjikt) fit your site? 
Answer: I don't know.

**AI:** Okay, let's look closer at [TK01-M005-01 (Kalkfattig semi-naturlig eng uten markrydding med åpent tresjikt)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0/T-C-PE-NA-MB-TK01-M005-01).

This type is characterized by being:
-   **Calcium-poor:** As indicated by the acidic-soil plants you observed.
-   **Semi-natural meadow:** Maintained by mowing or grazing, dominated by grasses.
-   **Without ploughing ("uten markrydding"):** The ground surface is generally smooth and undisturbed by cultivation.
-   **With open tree layer ("med åpent tresjikt"):** There are scattered trees or shrubs within the meadow area.
-   **Fresh ("frisk"):** This usually means the ground is moist but not waterlogged.

The "uten markrydding" aspect is important. It means the site hasn't been ploughed or heavily cultivated, leaving the soil structure relatively natural.

Explain: [TK01-M005-01 (Kalkfattig semi-naturlig eng uten markrydding med åpent tresjikt)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0/T-C-PE-NA-MB-TK01-M005-01) is defined as not having been ploughed or harrowed. This often results in an undisturbed, relatively smooth ground surface.
Question: Does the ground surface look undisturbed by past cultivation, without clear signs of old furrows or mixed-up soil layers? (yes/no)

**AI:** Thank you. The undisturbed ground surface is a key indicator that the site hasn't been ploughed or harrowed ("uten markrydding"). The presence of cows confirms it's a semi-natural meadow maintained by grazing.

Key indicators—calcium-poor conditions (acidic indicators), semi-natural management (grazing), undisturbed surface (no ploughing), and the presence of scattered trees—all support the classification.

Confirmed type: [TK01-M005-01 (Kalkfattig semi-naturlig eng uten markrydding med åpent tresjikt)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NiN-3.0/T-C-PE-NA-MB-TK01-M005-01)
