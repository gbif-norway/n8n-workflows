**Human:** - **General Environment:** Terrestrial  
- **Substrate Type:** Primarily mineral soil with small gravel and sparse patches of bare ground  
- **Moisture/Water Presence:** Appears dry to slightly moist; no visible standing or running water  
- **Vegetation Structure:** Low herbaceous cover, semi-open ground  
- **Dominant Plant Growth Forms:** Grasses (~60%), Mosses (~15%), Herbs/Forbs (~10%), Bare ground (~15%)  
- **Identifiable Plant Species:** Not clearly identifiable from image  
- **Surface Features/Topography:** Mostly flat with a very slight local relief; stone border visible on one side  
- **Exposure:** Appears moderately exposed; no clear sheltering vegetation or structures  
- **Signs of Natural Disturbance:** Not evident in the image  
- **Signs of Human Influence/Management:** Presence of a red plastic toy and a possible artificial stone border; likely managed or disturbed lawn area  
- **Other Notable Features:** Presence of scattered rocks at the edge; possible minor trampling or wear pattern in vegetation cover

**AI:** Based on your description of a terrestrial site with primarily mineral soil, low herbaceous cover dominated by grasses, and signs of human influence like a possible artificial stone border and minor trampling, the most likely major type group is Fastmarkssystemer.

**Human:** Question: Does NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer) fit your site? 
Answer: yes

**AI:** Okay, confirming **NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)** as the major type group.

Based on the dominance of grasses and signs of human management like a possible lawn or park setting, the most likely major type is Vegkanter, plener, parker og liknende uten semi-naturlig hevdpreg.
