**Human:** - **General Environment:** Terrestrial  
- **Substrate Type:** Mineral soil with scattered stones and boulders  
- **Moisture/Water Presence:** Moist ground; no visible standing or flowing water  
- **Vegetation Structure:** Predominantly open grassy area with adjacent forest edge; patchy ground vegetation transitioning into sparse tree cover  
- **Dominant Plant Growth Forms:** Grasses (~70%), Trees (~20%), Shrubs (~10%)  
- **Identifiable Plant Species:** Cannot confidently identify species from visible features; conifer (possibly Picea spp. or Pinus spp.) and presence of birch trees (likely Betula spp.) based on growth form and bark characteristics  
- **Surface Features/Topography:** Gently sloping terrain with some boulders on surface; backdrop of rising hill or low mountain  
- **Exposure:** Appears moderately exposed; no strong visual indicators of wind or water erosion  
- **Signs of Natural Disturbance:** Not clearly visible  
- **Signs of Human Influence/Management:** Possible past mowing or grazing due to maintained grassy area; presence of cut wood/log pieces suggests intermittent human activity  
- **Other Notable Features:** Presence of a single conifer tree in more open area indicates transitional zone between open grassland and forested slope

**AI:** Thank you for the detailed description of the site. Based on the information you provided, it sounds like we are dealing with a type of solid ground system.

Does [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T) fit your site? This group includes terrestrial habitats with mineral soil, scattered stones, and gentle slopes, which aligns with your description. (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer) fit your site? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Great. Within the [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T) group, your description of a predominantly open grassy area transitioning to forest, with possible signs of past management like mowing or grazing, strongly suggests a semi-natural meadow.

Does [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01) fit your site? This type covers open areas with herbaceous vegetation maintained by traditional land use like mowing or grazing, often found near forests. (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng) fit your site? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Thank you. We've established the Hovedtypegruppe is [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T) and the Hovedtype is [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01).

Now let's determine the specific mapping unit. The amount of calcium in the soil influences the types of plants that thrive there.

Does the area seem particularly rich in calcium? (yes/no)
