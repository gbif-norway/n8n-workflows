**Human:** Question: Approve NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng) as the major type? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Okay, we are now identifying the basic type (Grunntype) under [NA-TK01](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01) (Semi-naturlig eng). These types are mainly distinguished by calcium richness.

Here are the most likely basic types for an open semi-natural meadow without a prominent tree layer:

*   [TK01-13 (Kalkfattig åpen semi-naturlig ikke markryddet eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TK01-13) - Poor calcium open semi-natural meadow.
*   [TK01-14 (Svakt kalkrik åpen semi-naturlig ikke markryddet eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TK01-14) - Slightly calcareous open semi-natural meadow.
*   [TK01-15 (Klart kalkrik åpen semi-naturlig ikke markryddet eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TK01-15) - Clearly calcareous open semi-natural meadow.

Which of these descriptions best fits your site?

**Human:** How to distinguish them?

**AI:** You're right to ask for clarification! Distinguishing between these depends on the *calcium richness* of the soil.

Here are some field checks:

1.  **Geology:** Look at the underlying rocks. Is the bedrock or soil derived from limestone, marble, or other calcium-rich rocks? You might see white or greyish rock fragments.
2.  **Plants:** Certain plants prefer calcium-rich or calcium-poor soils.
    *   *Calcium-poor sites* often have species like Heather (*Calluna vulgaris*), Crowberry (*Empetrum nigrum*), Matgrass (*Nardus stricta*), or Hare's-tail Cottongrass (*Eriophorum vaginatum*).
    *   *Calcium-rich sites* might have species like Mountain Avens (*Dryas octopetala*, especially in mountain areas), species of Sedge (*Carex*), or certain orchids.
    *   *Moderate calcium sites* have a mix, without strong dominance of either calciphilous or calcifuge species.

Explain: “Calcium richness determines the specific type. Look at rocks and plants.”
Question: “Based on the rocks and plant species you see, would you describe the site as mainly poor, moderate, or rich in calcium? (poor / moderate / rich)”

**Human:** Question: Based on the rocks and plant species you see, is the site mainly poor, or is it mainly moderate or rich in calcium? 
Answer: Mainly moderate or rich

**AI:** Explain: “To distinguish between slightly and clearly calcareous meadows, look for plant species that are strong indicators of high calcium levels.”

Question: “Do you see plants typical of nutrient-rich, calcareous grasslands, such as species of Lady's Mantle (Alchemilla spp.), Kidney Vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), or certain sedges (like Carex flacca)? (yes/no)”

**Human:** Question: Do you see plants typical of nutrient-rich, calcareous grasslands, such as species of Lady's Mantle (Alchemilla spp.), Kidney Vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), or certain sedges (like Carex flacca)? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Explain: “The presence of species like Lady's Mantle, Kidney Vetch, or calciphilous sedges indicates clearly calcareous conditions.”

Confidence: High

**Human:** Question: Approve TK01-M005-26 (Klart kalkrik kildevannspåvirket semi-naturlig fukteng) as the basic type? 
Answer: yes

**Human:** I can't give you those capabilities because the input you get as a user is already AI generated from the image... Maybe you would like to write a prompt for it?

**AI:** Thank you for clarifying the input process. I understand now that the descriptions I receive are generated by an AI analyzing images, and I cannot ask for further real-time field observations from a human user.

This means my current interactive approach of asking targeted questions to gather more details about the site's characteristics isn't effective. To classify the site accurately according to the NiN 3.0 system, I need the image analysis AI to provide the relevant ecological information upfront in a structured format.

To make this tool more useful, the image analysis AI should extract specific features crucial for distinguishing between different NiN types from the image. Here is a prompt you could use for the image analysis AI to generate the detailed report I need:

**Prompt for Image Analysis AI:**

"Analyze the provided image of a natural site in Norway. Provide a detailed ecological description relevant to the NiN 3.0 system, presented as a bulleted list. Include the following characteristics:

- **General Environment:** Is the primary environment terrestrial (land), freshwater (lakes, rivers), marine (sea), or snow/ice?
- **Substrate Type:** Describe the dominant ground substrate (e.g., bare rock, mineral soil, sand, gravel, stones, boulders, peat, mud/gytje). Note the dominant particle size if it's loose inorganic sediment.
- **Moisture Regime:** Characterize the water conditions (e.g., dry, moist, wet, waterlogged, permanently submerged, temporarily flooded). Note if there are signs of water flow (springs, streams).
- **Vegetation Structure:** Describe the overall vegetation structure (e.g., forest (specify dominant tree type if possible), open ground with sparse vegetation, dense low vegetation like heath/grassland, wetland vegetation like moss carpet/tussocks, submerged plants).
- **Dominant Plant Groups:** Identify the most abundant plant groups (e.g., trees, dwarf shrubs, grasses, sedges, herbs, mosses, lichens, algae).
- **Visible Plant Species:** List any clearly identifiable plant species present, especially those known to be indicator species for different habitat types or calcium levels. Estimate their relative cover if possible.
- **Exposure:** Describe the site's exposure to wind, sun, or waves, if evident from the image.
- **Signs of Disturbance or Management:** Note any visible signs of recent natural disturbances (e.g., landslide, flood debris) or human activities (e.g., grazing, mowing, ditching, logging, construction).
- **Special Features:** Include any other prominent ecological features visible (e.g., caves, bird concentrations, signs of permafrost).

Format the output strictly as a bulleted list with the characteristic name in bold, followed by a colon and the description. For 'Visible Plant Species', list each identified species on a new line under that heading.

Example output format:
- **General Environment:** Terrestrial
- **Substrate Type:** Mineral soil, dominant particle size sand/gravel
- **Moisture Regime:** Dry to moist
- **Vegetation Structure:** Dense low vegetation (grassland/heath)
- **Dominant Plant Groups:** Grasses, Herbs
- **Visible Plant Species:**
  - Species A (e.g., Nardus stricta) (~40% cover)
  - Species B (e.g., Calluna vulgaris) (~10% cover)
  - Species C (e.g., Potentilla erecta) (~5%)
- **Exposure:** Moderately exposed
- **Signs of Disturbance or Management:** Evidence of grazing
- **Special Features:** None visible."

Once I receive a structured report like this, I can process the information to navigate the NiN hierarchy step-by-step, proposing a Hovedtypegruppe, then a Hovedtype, and finally a Grunntype, asking for your approval at each stage as per the established workflow.

This structured input, providing key ecological characteristics derived from the image analysis, would make my capabilities much more useful for classifying sites without needing interactive field checks.

**Human:** No I mean it is the physical user in the field that is answering the question. But the image user sends you at the beginning, is described by another AI because having agent bounce around many tokens of an image is inefficient... But you can help me set the system prompt for the AI descriptor before you

**AI:** Okay, I understand now. The field user provides input by *answering my specific questions*, but my initial understanding of the site comes from an AI-generated description based on an image. I cannot see the image myself.

This means the quality and detail of that initial AI description are critical for me to even start the classification process correctly and pose the *right* clarifying questions to the human user. The current issue is that the initial description might not contain the specific data points I need to navigate the NiN hierarchy effectively.

To make me more useful in this workflow, the AI describing the image needs a system prompt that instructs it to provide a detailed, objective ecological inventory of the site *as visible in the image*, focusing on the characteristics that are key differentiators in the NiN system.

Here is a suggested system prompt for the AI that generates the initial site description from the image:

---

**System Prompt for Image Description AI:**

"Analyze the provided image of a natural or semi-natural site in Norway. Your task is to generate a concise, objective, and ecologically focused description of the site *strictly based on visible elements in the image*. This description will be used by another AI for ecological classification according to the NiN 3.0 system.

Focus on providing factual observations relevant to habitat characteristics. Do not interpret beyond what is directly visible or infer conditions that are not clearly evident.

Provide the description as a bulleted list with the following headings. If a characteristic is not clearly discernible from the image, state 'Not clearly visible' or 'Cannot determine from image'.

- **General Environment:** (e.g., Terrestrial, Freshwater body, Freshwater bottom, Marine body, Marine bottom, Snow/Ice) - Choose the most dominant.
- **Substrate Type:** Describe the dominant substrate(s) visible. (e.g., Bare bedrock, Mineral soil, Peat, Sand, Gravel, Stones, Boulders, Mud/Silt, Fine organic material). If loose mineral sediment, note the dominant particle size if discernible.
- **Moisture/Water Presence:** Describe the visible water regime. (e.g., Dry, Moist ground, Standing water/Waterlogged, Running water/Stream, Submerged, Signs of temporary flooding). Note if a distinct water source (like a spring) is visible.
- **Vegetation Structure:** Describe the overall structure of the vegetation. (e.g., Open ground with sparse vegetation, Dense low vegetation (like heath or grassland), Forest (specify dominant tree type if possible, e.g., coniferous, deciduous), Wetland vegetation (e.g., moss carpet, tussocks, reeds), Aquatic vegetation).
- **Dominant Plant Growth Forms:** List the most visibly dominant plant groups. (e.g., Trees, Shrubs, Dwarf shrubs, Grasses, Sedges, Herbs/Forbs, Mosses, Lichens, Algae). Estimate rough relative cover if possible (e.g., 'Dwarf shrubs (~60%), Mosses (~20%), Grasses (~10%)').
- **Identifiable Plant Species:** List any plant species that are clearly identifiable from the image by their form, color, or other visible features. Use scientific or common names if known. (e.g., 'Calluna vulgaris', 'Sphagnum mosses').
- **Surface Features/Topography:** Note prominent physical features. (e.g., Flat, Sloping, Steep, Boulders/Rocks on surface, Hummocky, Patterned ground, Dunes, Cliffs, Caves/Overhangs). Note slope angle if estimable.
- **Exposure:** Describe visual clues related to exposure to elements. (e.g., Appears exposed to wind/waves, Appears sheltered).
- **Signs of Natural Disturbance:** Note visible evidence of recent natural processes. (e.g., Landslide debris, Erosion patterns, Flood deposits).
- **Signs of Human Influence/Management:** Note visible evidence of human activity. (e.g., Grazing, Mowing, Ditching, Cultivation, Tracks, Built structures, Logging).
- **Other Notable Features:** Include anything else ecologically relevant visible in the image. (e.g., Permanent snow patches, Ice features, Bird concentrations, Animal tracks).

Ensure the output is purely descriptive and uses the specified bullet point format."

**Why this prompt helps me:**

This prompt aims to provide me with a structured snapshot of the site's visual ecological characteristics. By giving me clear information on substrate, moisture, vegetation, and potential indicators (like species or surface features), I can more effectively:

1.  Propose the correct Hovedtypegruppe initially.
2.  Identify the most likely Hovedtype and Grunntype candidates within that group.
3.  Formulate targeted, efficient questions for the human field user based on the *missing* or *ambiguous* information in the description (e.g., asking about calcicity if the rock type isn't clear, or asking about ground feel if moisture level is uncertain from the image).

This structured input replaces the need for me to "interpret" a free-text, potentially less consistent AI description, allowing me to directly use the data points required for the NiN classification logic and focus on the necessary interactions with the human user for confirmation and clarifying field checks.

**AI:** Confirmed type: [TK01-M005-26](Klart kalkrik kildevannspåvirket semi-naturlig fukteng)
Confidence: High

**Human:** There is alchemile and viola growing there

**AI:** Thanks for providing the plant names. The presence of *Alchemilla* (Lady's Mantle) supports the indication of clearly calcareous conditions we discussed.

Based on the presence of plants like *Alchemilla* and your previous confirmation of plants typical of nutrient-rich, calcareous grasslands, [TK01-15](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TK01-15) (Klart kalkrik åpen semi-naturlig ikke markryddet eng) is the most fitting basic type.

Approve [TK01-15 (Klart kalkrik åpen semi-naturlig ikke markryddet eng)] as the basic type for your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Based on the presence of plants like Alchemilla and your previous confirmation of plants typical of nutrient-rich, calcareous grasslands, should TK01-15 (Klart kalkrik åpen semi-naturlig ikke markryddet eng) be approved as the basic type for your site? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Confirmed type: [TK01-15](Klart kalkrik åpen semi-naturlig ikke markryddet eng)
Confidence: High

**Human:** There is also a stream nearby which might flood it in the spring

**AI:** Thank you for providing that crucial detail. The presence of a stream that floods the area in the spring is a significant ecological factor that points to a different ecosystem type than the semi-natural grassland we were previously considering. Seasonal flooding defines floodplain communities.

This suggests the site might fit under [NA-TE08](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TE08) (Flommarkseng), which are floodplain meadows within the Fastmarkssystemer group, characterized by regular flooding.

Does [NA-TE08 (Flommarkseng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TE08) fit your site better, given the spring flooding from the nearby stream? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Given the spring flooding from the nearby stream, does NA-TE08 (Flommarkseng) fit your site better? 
Answer: No

**AI:** Okay, thank you for clarifying. Since the site doesn't fit the description of [NA-TE08](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TE08) (Flommarkseng), despite the spring flooding, it means the site's core characteristics align better with the [NA-TK01](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01) (Semi-naturlig eng) classification we previously established and you confirmed.

The spring flooding is an important ecological factor, but in this case, it seems to be influencing the expression of the semi-natural grassland rather than defining it as a primary floodplain system. We will note the presence of spring flooding as an ecological supplementary characteristic for the site.

Based on the confirmed Hovedtype [NA-TK01](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01) and the presence of species like *Alchemilla* indicating clearly calcareous conditions, the Grunntype you approved, [TK01-15](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TK01-15) (Klart kalkrik åpen semi-naturlig ikke markryddet eng), remains the best fit for your site.

Confirmed type: [TK01-15](Klart kalkrik åpen semi-naturlig ikke markryddet eng)
Confidence: High

**AI:** Okay, thank you for clarifying that the ground remains moist but not waterlogged through the summer.

Persistent moisture throughout the summer points towards a moist grassland type within the semi-natural grasslands, especially in calcareous areas which can be influenced by groundwater or springs.

Approve [TK01-M005-26 (Klart kalkrik kildevannspåvirket semi-naturlig fukteng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TK01-M005-26) as the basic type? (yes/no)

**Human:** Which species should I look for?

**AI:** We have already confirmed the basic type for your site as [TK01-15](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TK01-15) (Klart kalkrik åpen semi-naturlig ikke markryddet eng) based on your previous answers, including the presence of species like *Alchemilla* and *Viola*, which are good indicators of clearly calcareous conditions.

Sites classified as [TK01-15](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TK01-15) are characterized by a rich diversity of herbs and grasses that thrive in nutrient-rich, calcium-rich soil, with limited cover of mosses and lichens. Besides *Alchemilla* (Lady's Mantle) and *Viola* (Violets, some species like *Viola rupestris* or *Viola collina* prefer calcareous ground), you might typically find species such as various clovers (*Trifolium* spp.), Common Bird's-foot Trefoil (*Lotus corniculatus*), various hawkweeds (*Hieracium* spp.), and calciphilous sedges like *Carex flacca* (Glaucous Sedge) or *Carex caryophyllea* (Spring Sedge). The overall appearance is that of a species-rich meadow on firm ground.

**Human:** Im not sure

**AI:** Okay, I understand. Let's look closer. We've confirmed the site is a semi-natural grassland ([NA-TK01](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01)) with plants indicating it's clearly calcareous ([Klart kalkrik]).

Within the clearly calcareous semi-natural grasslands, the amount of moisture in the soil is a key factor that helps distinguish between types like fresh meadows and moist meadows.

Does the ground remain moist, but not waterlogged, throughout the summer growing season? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does the ground remain moist, but not waterlogged, throughout the summer growing season? 
Answer: Yes
