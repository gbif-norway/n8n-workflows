**Human:** - **General Environment:** Terrestrial  
- **Substrate Type:** Mineral soil with a surface layer of grass and organic litter  
- **Moisture/Water Presence:** Moist ground (no visible surface water, but vegetation suggests non-dry conditions)  
- **Vegetation Structure:** Dense low vegetation (grassland) with sparse herbaceous components  
- **Dominant Plant Growth Forms:** Grasses (~70%), Herbs/Forbs (~20%), Dwarf shrubs or mosses not clearly visible  
- **Identifiable Plant Species:** One violet-flowered forb, possibly in the genus *Viola* (e.g., *Viola canina* or similar)  
- **Surface Features/Topography:** Flat to gently sloping terrain  
- **Exposure:** Appears moderately exposed (no clear sheltering features; open field with visible tree line in back)  
- **Signs of Natural Disturbance:** Not clearly visible  
- **Signs of Human Influence/Management:** Possible low-intensity management (e.g., mowing or grazing implied by short grass), but no direct evidence in image  
- **Other Notable Features:** Scattered coniferous trees visible in background suggesting a transition zone toward forested area

**AI:** Based on your description of a terrestrial site with mineral soil, moist ground but no standing water, and dense low grassland vegetation, the most likely major type group is Fastmarkssystemer.
