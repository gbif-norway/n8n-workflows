**Human:** - **General Environment:** Terrestrial  
- **Substrate Type:** Mineral soil with significant litter cover; some exposed patches appear to show fine organic material and decayed leaf matter  
- **Moisture/Water Presence:** Moist ground (no visible surface water, but ground vegetation and density suggest adequate soil moisture)  
- **Vegetation Structure:** Forest with both understory vegetation and canopy layers; mostly deciduous with sparse to moderate midstory shading  
- **Dominant Plant Growth Forms:**  
  - Trees (~40%)  
  - Herbs/Forbs (~40%)  
  - Shrubs and saplings (~10%)  
  - Mosses (~10%)  
- **Identifiable Plant Species:**  
  - Likely Betula spp. (visible birch trunks)  
  - Possible Urtica dioica (nettles) or similar herbs in the understory, not confirmed  
- **Surface Features/Topography:** Mostly flat with slight undulations; leaf litter visible across surface  
- **Exposure:** Appears somewhat sheltered due to tree canopy and forest setting  
- **Signs of Natural Disturbance:** Not clearly visible  
- **Signs of Human Influence/Management:**  
  - No obvious constructed features or recent management; possible historical low-intervention (e.g., secondary regrowth) not directly confirmable  
- **Other Notable Features:** None visible beyond the natural forest composition

**AI:** Based on your description of a terrestrial forest with moist mineral soil, understory vegetation, and canopy cover, it sounds like it falls within the major type group of terrestrial systems.
