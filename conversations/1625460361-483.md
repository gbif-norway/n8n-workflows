**Human:** - **General Environment:** Terrestrial

- **Substrate Type:** Dominantly covered with a layer of moss over mineral soil; presence of leaf litter; scattered fine organic materials and some small stones.

- **Moisture/Water Presence:** Appears dry to slightly moist; no standing or running water is visible.

- **Vegetation Structure:** Forest with moderate canopy cover; ground layer dominated by mosses and scattered low vegetation, sparse understorey.

- **Dominant Plant Growth Forms:**  
  - Trees (~50%)  
  - Mosses (~30%)  
  - Dwarf shrubs/Herbs and grasses (~20%)  

- **Identifiable Plant Species:**  
  - Cannot determine specific species with certainty; possibly presence of *Pleurozium schreberi* or *Hylocomium splendens* (common boreal mosses), but not clearly identifiable.  
  - Tree form suggests coniferous species, possibly *Picea abies* (Norway spruce) or similar, but cannot confirm.

- **Surface Features/Topography:** Moderate slope; gently sloping terrain with no steep inclines visible; irregular micro-topography with natural mounds and slight depressions.

- **Exposure:** Appears moderately sheltered by tree cover; no evidence of significant wind exposure visible.

- **Signs of Natural Disturbance:** None clearly visible.

- **Signs of Human Influence/Management:** None clearly visible; no built structures, tracks, or signs of recent logging or forest management.

- **Other Notable Features:** Thick moss layer suggests relatively undisturbed ground; no visible snow patches, animal tracks, or distinctive fauna features.

**AI:** Based on your description of a terrestrial forest environment with mosses, leaf litter, and moderate canopy cover, the most likely major type group is Terrestrial systems.

Does [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T) fit your site? It's fairly easy to recognize from characteristics like mineral soil substrate and vegetation not primarily shaped by water levels or marine/freshwater aquatic environments. (yes/no)
