**Human:** Hva definerer na-tb01?

**AI:** Okay, I see that the search for just "NA-TB01" didn't yield a direct hit as a standalone Hovedtype. It seems that NA-TB01 is a Hovedtype *within* a larger group.

Based on the codes, NA-TB01 belongs to the Hovedtypegruppe [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T). Fastmarkssystemer generally include terrestrial environments that are not wetlands, rivers, lakes, or marine areas.
