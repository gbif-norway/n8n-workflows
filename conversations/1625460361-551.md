**Human:** Question: Does NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer) fit your site? 
Answer: Yes

**Human:** - **General Environment:** Terrestrial  
- **Substrate Type:** Mineral soil with a thin cover of organic material (partly decomposed grass litter visible)  
- **Moisture/Water Presence:** Moist ground (no visible pooling of water but grass appears healthy and green indicating regular moisture)  
- **Vegetation Structure:** Dense low vegetation (grassland)  
- **Dominant Plant Growth Forms:** Grasses (~70%), Forbs/Herbs (~20%), Dwarf shrubs (~5%), Mosses (~5%)  
- **Identifiable Plant Species:** Likely Viola species (violet flower in foreground)  
- **Surface Features/Topography:** Flat to gently sloping  
- **Exposure:** Appears moderately exposed (no shelter structures visible; open grassland suggests exposure to wind and precipitation)  
- **Signs of Natural Disturbance:** Not clearly visible  
- **Signs of Human Influence/Management:** Possible signs of past mowing or light grazing (uniform grass height, no tall herbaceous growth)  
- **Other Notable Features:** Presence of coniferous trees in background suggests mosaic habitat with adjacent forested areas

**AI:** Based on your description of a terrestrial site with mineral soil, moist ground without standing water, and dense low grassland vegetation, the most probable major type group is [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/ पर्यावरणीय-systemer/Natursystem/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T).

Does [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/ पर्यावरणीय-systemer/Natursystem/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T) fit your site? (yes/no)

**AI:** Great, [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/ पर्यावरणीय-systemer/Natursystem/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-NA-T) it is.

Based on the description of a moist grassland with signs of possible past management like mowing or grazing, [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/ पर्यावरणीय-systemer/Natursystem/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01) is a likely fit. This type includes grasslands maintained by traditional methods.

Does [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/ पर्यावरणीय-systemer/Natursystem/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng) fit your site? 
Answer: yes

**AI:** Based on your description, [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/ पर्यावरणीय-systemer/Natursystem/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01) seems appropriate as it covers grasslands maintained by traditional methods like mowing or grazing.

Now let's refine the classification. The calcium content of the soil is important for differentiating types of semi-natural meadows. Some grasses like mat-grass (*Nardus stricta*) often indicate calcium-poor conditions.

Is mat-grass (*Nardus stricta*) one of the dominant grasses (say, over 20% cover) at your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Is mat-grass (Nardus stricta) one of the dominant grasses (say, over 20% cover) at your site? 
Answer: no

**AI:** Okay, *Nardus stricta* not being dominant indicates the site is likely not strongly calcium-poor.

Meadows with more calcium often host a wider variety of wildflowers, including certain orchids.

Are there orchids (e.g., *Orchis* species, *Gymnadenia* species) present at the site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Are orchids (e.g., Orchis species, Gymnadenia species) present at the site? 
Answer: No, orchids are not present.

**AI:** Based on the likely management and your description of the vegetation, [TK01-M005-20 (Svakt kalkrik åpen semi-naturlig markryddet eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TK01-M005-20) seems like a strong candidate. This type fits open grasslands that are managed (like by mowing or grazing) and have a slightly higher calcium content than calcium-poor types, but not enough for calciphilous orchids.

Approve [TK01-M005-20 (Svakt kalkrik åpen semi-naturlig markryddet eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NiN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-TK01-M005-20) as the basic type? (yes/no)
