**AI:** Okay, I can help you classify this site based on your description.

Based on your description of a terrestrial site with mineral soil, dense low grass vegetation, and adjacent forest, the most probable Hovedtypegruppe is [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA).

Does [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer) fit your site? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Okay, great. Within the [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NA) group, your description of a grass-dominated open area with signs of possible mowing or grazing, adjacent to forest, sounds like [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/TK01).

Does [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/TK01) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng) fit your site? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Okay, that confirms [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/TK01) as the Hovedtype.

Now, let's determine the specific Kartleggingsenhet within Semi-naturlig eng. Your description points towards types that are moist and have an open tree layer. A key factor distinguishing the types at this level is the soil's calcium content.

Is the ground or bedrock at your site clearly calcareous (feels chalky, or contains fragmented shells or calcium-rich rocks)? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Given the context of NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng) being confirmed as the Hovedtype and determining the specific Kartleggingsenhet within Semi-naturlig eng, where moist types with an open tree layer are considered and calcium content is a key distinguishing factor, is the ground or bedrock at your site clearly calcareous (feels chalky, or contains fragmented shells or calcium-rich rocks)? 
Answer: No

**AI:** Okay, thank you. Based on your confirmation of [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/TK01) and that the site is not clearly calcareous, the most likely Kartleggingsenhet is [TK01-M005-13 (Kalkfattig åpen semi-naturlig ikke markryddet eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/TK01-M005-013). This type fits sites that are semi-natural open meadows without a significant tree layer or signs of ground clearing, and are calcareous poor.

Does [TK01-M005-13 (Kalkfattig åpen semi-naturlig ikke markryddet eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/TK01-M005-013) fit your site description? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does TK01-M005-13 (Kalkfattig åpen semi-naturlig ikke markryddet eng) fit your site description? 
Answer: I don't know.

**AI:** Okay, thank you for clarifying. The previous code [TK01-M005-13](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/TK01-M005-013) might not be the most fitting.

Based on your description of a non-calcareous site within [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/TK01), the most appropriate Kartleggingsenhet appears to be [NA-TK01-M050-01 (Kalkfattig til svakt kalkrik åpen semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01-M050-01). This type covers semi-natural open meadows with low to slightly higher calcium levels.

Does [NA-TK01-M050-01 (Kalkfattig til svakt kalkrik åpen semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/NIN-3.0-T-C-PE-NA-MB-A-TK01-M050-01) fit your site description? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TK01-M050-01 (Kalkfattig til svakt kalkrik åpen semi-naturlig eng) fit your site description? 
Answer: I don't know.

**AI:** Okay, I understand that the previous codes might not feel like a perfect fit yet. We know the site is a semi-natural meadow ([NA-TK01](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/TK01)) that isn't clearly calcareous and has moist ground.

Some semi-natural meadows get their moisture from general soil wetness, while others are specifically influenced by spring water seeping up. This distinction is important for classifying the exact type.

Look for small areas where water seems to be seeping out of the ground, or plants like Sphagnum moss, sedges (Carex spp.), or rushes (Juncus spp.) forming denser patches. Are there clear signs of spring water influence or seepage areas? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Considering the site is a semi-natural meadow (NA-TK01) that isn't clearly calcareous and has moist ground, and looking for signs like small areas of seeping water, Sphagnum moss, sedges (Carex spp.), or rushes (Juncus spp.) forming denser patches, are there clear signs of spring water influence or seepage areas? 
Answer: No

**AI:** Okay, we've confirmed the site is a semi-natural meadow ([NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/TK01)) with moist, non-calcareous ground and no signs of spring influence.

Bilberry thrives in acidic, calcium-poor soil, less so in slightly more base-rich conditions.

Is bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) present with significant cover (> 10%)? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Is bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) present with significant cover (> 10%)? 
Answer: No

**AI:** Okay, thank you. We've established the site is a semi-natural meadow ([NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/TK01)) with moist, non-calcareous ground and no signs of spring influence or significant bilberry cover.

To distinguish between the less calcareous open meadow types, we can look for plants that prefer slightly richer soil. Red Clover (*Trifolium pratense*) is a common indicator of somewhat higher calcium levels compared to very calcium-poor sites.

Is Red Clover (*Trifolium pratense*) present at your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Is Red Clover (Trifolium pratense) present at your site? 
Answer: no

**AI:** Okay, thank you. We know the site is a semi-natural meadow ([NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/TK01)) with moist, non-calcareous ground, no spring influence, and no significant bilberry or red clover.

To help determine if the soil is calcium-poor or slightly more base-rich within this type, we can look for other indicator plants. Ox-eye Daisy (*Leucanthemum vulgare*) is often found in slightly more nutrient-rich meadows than very calcium-poor ones.

Is Ox-eye Daisy (*Leucanthemum vulgare*) present at your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Is Ox-eye Daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare) present at your site? 
Answer: No

**AI:** Okay, thank you. We know the site is a semi-natural meadow ([NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/TK01)) with moist, non-calcareous ground, no spring influence, and no significant bilberry, Red Clover, or Ox-eye Daisy.

To pinpoint the exact type, we need to distinguish between meadows that are truly calcium-poor and those that are slightly richer. Meadow Buttercup is a common plant in slightly calcium-rich meadows.

Is Meadow Buttercup (*Ranunculus acris*) present at your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Is Meadow Buttercup (Ranunculus acris) present at your site? 
Answer: no

**AI:** Okay, based on your answers:
- The site is a semi-natural meadow ([NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/TK01)).
- The ground is not clearly calcareous.
- There are no signs of spring water influence.
- Indicator plants for richer soil or moist conditions like bilberry, Red Clover, Ox-eye Daisy, and Meadow Buttercup are absent.

These cues strongly suggest a calcium-poor, open, semi-natural meadow that is not significantly influenced by ground clearing (like removing stones or leveling, different from mowing or grazing).

This points to [TK01-M005-13 (Kalkfattig åpen semi-naturlig ikke markryddet eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/TK01-M005-013).

Does [TK01-M005-13 (Kalkfattig åpen semi-naturlig ikke markryddet eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/TK01-M005-013) fit your site description? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does TK01-M005-13 (Kalkfattig åpen semi-naturlig ikke markryddet eng) fit your site description? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Based on your confirmations that the site is a semi-natural meadow with moist, non-calcareous ground, no spring influence, and the absence of indicator species like bilberry, Red Clover, Ox-eye Daisy, and Meadow Buttercup, the characteristics strongly support this classification.

Confirmed type: [TK01-M005-013 (Kalkfattig åpen semi-naturlig ikke markryddet eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/TK01-M005-013)
Confidence: High

To make this tool more useful, it would be helpful to be able to directly query the tool about the characteristics and indicator species associated with specific NIN codes at different levels of the hierarchy.
