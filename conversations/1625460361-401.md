**Human:** - **General Environment:** Terrestrial  
- **Substrate Type:** Mineral soil with presence of fine organic material and scattered leaf litter  
- **Moisture/Water Presence:** Appears dry to slightly moist ground; no standing or running water visible  
- **Vegetation Structure:** Low, mixed vegetation cover; seems consistent with grassland or meadow vegetation structure  
- **Dominant Plant Growth Forms:** Herbs/Forbs (~50%), Grasses (~30%), Mosses (~10%), Dwarf shrubs (~10%)  
- **Identifiable Plant Species:** Viola sp. (likely Viola canina or similar species from the Viola genus)  
- **Surface Features/Topography:** Mostly flat to gently sloping; no large rocks or topographic complexity visible  
- **Exposure:** Appears moderately exposed; no sheltering structures or dense tree canopy present in the image  
- **Signs of Natural Disturbance:** Not clearly visible  
- **Signs of Human Influence/Management:** Not clearly visible; no apparent structures, trampling, or agricultural signs  
- **Other Notable Features:** Presence of senescent vegetation suggests seasonal transition (e.g., early spring or late autumn)

**AI:** Based on your description of a terrestrial site with dry to slightly moist mineral soil and mixed vegetation cover dominated by herbs and grasses, the most likely major type group is Fastmarkssystemer.

Does [NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0/T/C/PE/NA/MB/NA-T) fit your site? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-T (Fastmarkssystemer) fit your site? 
Answer: Yes

**AI:** Explain: Semi-natural grasslands and meadows are characterized by mixed vegetation dominated by herbs and grasses on dry to slightly moist soil.
Question: Does [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0/T/C/PE/NA/MB/A-TK01) fit your site description? (yes/no)

**Human:** Question: Does NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng) fit your site description? 
Answer: yes

**AI:** Okay, we have identified the major type as [NA-TK01 (Semi-naturlig eng)](https://naturinorge.artsdatabanken.no/Naturtype/NIN-3.0/T/C/PE/NA/MB/A-TK01). Now let's try to narrow down the specific mapping unit (kartleggingsenhet).

Based on your description of dry to slightly moist ground with open, mixed vegetation dominated by herbs and grasses, a likely fit within Semi-naturlig eng is a slightly calcareous open semi-natural meadow.
